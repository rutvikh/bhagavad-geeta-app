Dadaji saw this as profoundly significant: Kurukshetra is not merely a battlefield, it is a holy field consecrated through ages of righteous action and pilgrimage. The word 'Mama' (mine) in 'mamakah' reveals Dhritarashtra's attachment — he sees his sons as separate from Pandu's sons, as 'mine' versus 'theirs.' This possessive attachment is the root of all conflict. Dadaji taught that the entire Mahabharata war arose from this single word 'mine' — mine is my family, mine is my kingdom. The Geeta is ultimately the teaching that dissolves this false sense of mine-ness and reveals the One Self in all.","sarvapriyananda":"From the Vedantic perspective, the opening question of the Geeta is deeply symbolic. Kurukshetra — the field of dharma — represents the very field of human consciousness where the eternal battle between the higher and lower nature takes place. Dhritarashtra is physically blind and spiritually blind — he cannot see either the field or the inner nature of events. He must rely on Sanjaya, whose name means 'the totally victorious' — one who has conquered all inner obstacles. The Geeta's teaching unfolds through this narrative frame: the truly blind (attached) must listen carefully to the one whose inner sight is clear.","yogananda":"Yogananda interprets this opening verse metaphysically. Dhritarashtra represents the ego-self — blind, attached, unable to witness its own inner battlefield objectively. Kurukshetra is the field of the body and mind. The question 'what did my sons and Pandu's sons do?' represents the eternal inner conflict between the ego-driven faculties (the hundred Kauravas) and the soul-aligned faculties (the five Pandavas). Every human being faces this battlefield daily. The Geeta's teaching is the eternal answer to the ego's confused question.","goyandka":"According to Goyandka's classical analysis, the use of 'Dharmakshetra' to describe Kurukshetra is historically and spiritually precise. Kurukshetra was known from the Vedic age as a sacred pilgrimage site where righteous acts bore multiplied fruit. Dhritarashtra, harboring the hope that the sacred atmosphere might soften his sons' hearts toward dharma, uses this term deliberately. His question to Sanjaya reveals his anxiety — despite possessing divine sight granted by Vyasa, Sanjaya must be questioned, for Dhritarashtra cannot bear to remain in ignorance about the fate of his blind attachment to his sons."}},{"verse":2,"sanskrit":"सञ्जय उवाच ।\\nदृष्ट्वा तु पाण्डवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा ।\\nआचार्यमुपसङ्गम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत् ॥","transliteration":"sañjaya uvāca\\ndṛṣṭvā tu pāṇḍavānīkaṃ vyūḍhaṃ duryodhanas tadā\\nācāryam upasaṅgamya rājā vacanam abravīt","translation":"Sanjaya said: Having seen the Pandava army arrayed in battle formation, King Duryodhana then approached his teacher Drona and spoke these words.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch01/verse_01_02.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"दृष्ट्वा","transliteration":"dṛṣṭvā","root":"√dṛś (to see)","grammatical_form":"Absolutive (gerund)","meaning":"having seen"},{"word":"पाण्डवानीकम्","transliteration":"pāṇḍavānīkam","root":"Pāṇḍava + anīka","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, accusative","meaning":"the Pandava army / battle formation"},{"word":"व्यूढम्","transliteration":"vyūḍham","root":"vi + √vah (to carry/arrange)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, accusative, neuter","meaning":"arrayed / arranged in battle formation"},{"word":"दुर्योधनः","transliteration":"duryodhanaḥ","root":"dur + yodhana","grammatical_form":"Proper noun, masculine, nominative","meaning":"Duryodhana (difficult to fight against)"},{"word":"आचार्यम्","transliteration":"ācāryam","root":"√car (to conduct)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, accusative","meaning":"the teacher (Drona)"},{"word":"उपसङ्गम्य","transliteration":"upasaṅgamya","root":"upa + sam + √gam (to go)","grammatical_form":"Absolutive","meaning":"having approached"},{"word":"वचनम्","transliteration":"vacanam","root":"√vac (to speak)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, accusative","meaning":"words / speech"},{"word":"अब्रवीत्","transliteration":"abravīt","root":"√brū (to speak)","grammatical_form":"Imperfect, 3rd person singular","meaning":"he said / he spoke"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Duryodhana approaches Drona — his teacher — in a moment of anxiety. This reveals an important truth: even the ego, when threatened, seeks guidance from wisdom. Yet Duryodhana does not approach Drona for knowledge but for reassurance and strategy. He wants to use his teacher's wisdom for selfish ends. Dadaji often pointed out this distinction: approaching a teacher with genuine desire for truth versus approaching for confirmation of one's own views. The latter is not real discipleship.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse establishes the contrast between outward seeing and inward understanding. Duryodhana 'sees' the Pandava army — but what does he truly see? He sees only opponents, threats, objects to be overcome. The entire Geeta can be seen as a shift from this limited way of seeing to the divine vision that Krishna eventually grants Arjuna. The movement from duryodhana-vision (seeing only conflict and otherness) to arjuna-vision refined by Krishna's teaching is the Geeta's spiritual journey.","yogananda":"Duryodhana going to his teacher Drona represents the ego consulting the buddhi (higher intellect) in a moment of crisis. But notice — Duryodhana goes to Drona not to ask 'What is truth?' but to bolster his own position. This is the ego using the intellect as a servant of its own agenda. Yoga teaches the opposite: placing the intellect in service of the Self, not the ego. Drona, despite being a great teacher, is on the wrong side of this war — another symbol of how even wisdom can be captured in service of the lower nature.","goyandka":"The grammar of this verse is precise and telling. 'Having seen' (dṛṣṭvā) comes first — Duryodhana acts entirely from seeing, from appearances. He is moved by what he perceives with his outer eyes. The contrast with Dhritarashtra (who cannot see at all) is pointed: Duryodhana can see, but sees only the surface. He approaches his Acharya — his spiritual teacher and preceptor — but approaches him as a king consulting a military advisor, not as a student seeking guidance. This misuse of the teacher-student relationship is itself a form of adharma."}},{"verse":47,"sanskrit":"सञ्जय उवाच ।\\nएवमुक्त्वार्जुनः सङ्ख्ये रथोपस्थ उपाविशत् ।\\nविसृज्य सशरं चापं शोकसंविग्नमानसः ॥","transliteration":"sañjaya uvāca\\nevam uktvārjunaḥ saṅkhye rathopastha upāviśat\\nvisṛjya sa-śaraṃ cāpaṃ śoka-saṃvigna-mānasaḥ","translation":"Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus in the midst of the battlefield, Arjuna sat down upon the seat of the chariot, casting aside his bow and arrows, with a mind overwhelmed by grief.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch01/verse_01_47.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"एवम्","transliteration":"evam","root":"—","grammatical_form":"Indeclinable adverb","meaning":"thus / in this way"},{"word":"उक्त्वा","transliteration":"uktvā","root":"√vac (to speak)","grammatical_form":"Absolutive","meaning":"having spoken"},{"word":"अर्जुनः","transliteration":"arjunaḥ","root":"arjuna (bright, pure)","grammatical_form":"Proper noun, masculine, nominative","meaning":"Arjuna"},{"word":"रथोपस्थे","transliteration":"rathopasthe","root":"ratha + upastha","grammatical_form":"Compound, locative, masculine","meaning":"on the seat of the chariot"},{"word":"विसृज्य","transliteration":"visṛjya","root":"vi + √sṛj (to release)","grammatical_form":"Absolutive","meaning":"having cast aside / having let go of"},{"word":"सशरम्","transliteration":"sa-śaram","root":"sa + śara (arrow)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, accusative","meaning":"together with arrows"},{"word":"चापम्","transliteration":"cāpam","root":"cāpa (bow)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, accusative","meaning":"bow (the Gandiva)"},{"word":"शोकसंविग्नमानसः","transliteration":"śoka-saṃvigna-mānasaḥ","root":"śoka (grief) + saṃvigna (agitated) + mānasa (mind)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative","meaning":"with a mind overwhelmed and agitated by grief"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The falling of Arjuna's bow is one of the most significant moments in the Geeta. The Gandiva — the greatest bow in the world, given by Agni himself — falls from Arjuna's hands. Dadaji saw this as a powerful symbol: our greatest instruments of action become useless when the heart is clouded by attachment. No skill, no talent, no external power can function properly when the inner being is overwhelmed by ego-driven grief. Arjuna's collapse is ultimately the most important thing that could have happened — for it is precisely this moment of human helplessness that creates the space for divine teaching. God's grace flows most fully into an empty vessel.","sarvapriyananda":"From the Vedantic perspective, the first chapter's closing image — Arjuna sitting collapsed in his chariot, bow fallen, arrows scattered — represents the soul's encounter with its own limitation. The ego has reached its point of exhaustion. When all human strategies for dealing with life's contradictions fail, when the greatest warrior cannot fight, when the most capable person cannot act — that is the moment of genuine spiritual readiness. Arjuna's grief is not weakness but the beginning of wisdom. The Upanishads say 'when the bow of the ego breaks, the Self is revealed.' The Geeta begins exactly here.","yogananda":"Arjuna sits down in his chariot overwhelmed by grief (shoka). Yogananda saw this as representing the soul's state when it first encounters the full reality of the inner battlefield. The chariot represents the body; the horses, the senses; Arjuna, the will; Krishna, the Higher Self seated behind, guiding. When the will (Arjuna) collapses in confusion, the Higher Self (Krishna) must take command and provide the teaching of the ages. The entire Bhagavad Geeta — all 700 verses — flows from this one moment of Arjuna's surrender of his limited ego. It is the most productive breakdown in all of human literature.","goyandka":"The chapter closes with Arjuna's psychological collapse precisely described. The compound 'shoka-samvigna-manasah' — a mind thoroughly agitated by grief — is grammatically rich: grief (shoka) causes agitation (samvigna) which pervades the entire mind (manasa). This is not mere sadness but a comprehensive mental crisis. Classical commentators note that Arjuna's confusion is genuine and praiseworthy: he is not a coward but a man of deep feeling who recognizes the full human cost of the action before him. His grief arises from dharmic concern, not mere personal attachment — and this makes him the perfect student for the teaching about to be given."}}]`),t={chapter:1,verses:a};export{e as chapter,t as default,a as verses};
