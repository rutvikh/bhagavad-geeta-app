He is not speaking about something new — this yoga is sanātana, eternal. It passed from the sun itself, that blazing source of all life, down through the first man Manu, and then to the great king Ikshvaku who founded the Solar dynasty. Beta, when the Lord says 'I taught this,' He is reminding us that Truth never originates with a human teacher. All genuine spiritual teaching is but the remembering of what the Divine has already placed in the heart. The chain of transmission — guru to shishya, father to child, elder to younger — is how the sacred flame is kept alive. Do not think this yoga belongs to one age or one people. It is as old as the sun itself.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse introduces us to the crucial Vedantic concept of paramparā — the unbroken chain of transmission. The Lord declares that He himself is the original guru of this yoga. Who is this 'I' that taught? Not the personal form of Krishna alone, but the eternal Consciousness that manifests as each avatar. Vivasvat, Manu, Ikshvaku — these are not merely historical figures but represent successive planes of manifestation through which the one Truth descends into human understanding. The yoga is called avyayam — imperishable — because it belongs to the realm of the Absolute, not to time. What is taught in true paramparā is not information but transformation. The teacher transmits a living realization, and the tradition ensures this flame of Self-knowledge is never extinguished.","yogananda":"The divine yoga that Christ called 'the way, the truth, and the life' is the same eternal science here identified by Krishna as the yoga He taught to Vivasvat, the sun-god — cosmic energy itself. This is Kriya Yoga, the inner science of life-force control, conveyed from the original divine guru through a succession of illumined masters. Manu represents cosmic mind; Ikshvaku, the first application of this wisdom in righteous governance of life. The esoteric meaning is profound: the soul's inner sun (the spiritual eye) must first receive wisdom; the mind (Manu) must then assimilate it; and finally the will and body (Ikshvaku, the king) must express it in right action. Every true spiritual lineage traces itself ultimately to God, the one Guru.","goyandka":"In the very first verse of this chapter the Lord establishes the divine and eternal origin of the Gita's yoga. He spoke this same teaching first to Vivasvat, the presiding deity of the sun and the source of all physical sustenance. Vivasvat transmitted it to Manu — Vaivasvata Manu, the progenitor of this present human age — and Manu in turn taught it to Ikshvaku, the first of the Solar dynasty kings. This establishes that yoga-knowledge is not a modern invention but an ancient revelation given at the very dawn of human civilization. The Gita Press commentators note that the Lord uses proktavān, the past perfect, indicating this transmission happened at the beginning of creation itself, before the current human cycle. The teaching is avyayam — it does not wear out or become obsolete with the passage of time."}},{"verse":2,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nएवं परम्पराप्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदुः ।\\nस कालेनेह महता योगो नष्टः परन्तप ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nevaṃ paramparā-prāptam imaṃ rājarṣayo viduḥ\\nsa kāleneha mahatā yogo naṣṭaḥ paran-tapa","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Received through this sacred, unbroken lineage, the royal sages who were also seers of Truth came to know this immortal yoga.

The rājarṣis, those magnificent souls who were both kings and sages, did receive this wisdom and governed their kingdoms from the platform of Self-knowledge. But as the ages turned, as Kali Yuga's shadows grew longer, the pure thread was broken. How? Not through any external force, but through forgetfulness, through intellectual pride, through the slow drift away from the living guru relationship. Beta, this is why the Lord must return again and again — not because God has changed, but because we humans keep losing the thread. When you feel yourself drifting from your practice, from satsang, from the guru's grace — remember: even the civilization of the rājarṣis could lose this yoga. Stay close to the source.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse contains a sober and important observation about the sociology of spiritual knowledge. Paramparā-prāptam — received through the unbroken chain — this is the gold standard of Vedantic transmission. The rājarṣis embodied a beautiful ideal: temporal power and spiritual realization united in one person. But kālena — by time, that great dissolver — even this elevated tradition was lost. What does 'lost' mean here? Not that the Upanishads were burned or the texts destroyed. It means the living understanding, the direct realization behind the words, faded. Texts survived but became mere ritual recitation without penetrating insight. This is why the Vedantic tradition insists so emphatically that Self-knowledge must be received from a living, realized teacher. Without that, even the most sacred scripture becomes an empty shell.","yogananda":"The great divine-human civilization of the rājarṣis — scientist-kings and sage-rulers — represents what humanity can become when yoga-knowledge is practiced in its fullness. These enlightened rulers governed not from ambition but from cosmic attunement. But kāla, the relentless wheel of cyclic time, obscures even the greatest light. This is why the great masters repeatedly return: Elijah, John the Baptist, Babaji — the line of avatāras and mahāvatāras who keep re-igniting the flame. The word naṣṭaḥ, 'lost,' does not mean annihilated; it means covered over, as the sun is covered by clouds. The yoga was never truly destroyed — it was preserved in the souls of the illumined, waiting for the divine moment of re-revelation, which comes precisely in verse 3.","goyandka":"The Lord confirms that this paramparā — the sacred succession — was once maintained perfectly by the rājarṣis, the royal sages who combined kingly authority with spiritual depth. Janaka, Ashvapati, and others of that lineage exemplified how a ruler could be a jñānī. But in the course of mahā-kāla, the great cosmic time cycle, this living tradition became naṣṭa — lost, not in its textual form but in its realized experiential transmission. The commentators of Gita Press observe that 'here on earth' (iha) is significant: the teaching may be eternally preserved in the higher lokas and in the Lord's own memory, but its practical currency among human beings was broken. This is precisely why a new direct transmission from the Lord Himself — to Arjuna, and through the Gita to all of humanity — becomes necessary."}},{"verse":3,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nस एवायं मया तेऽद्य योगः प्रोक्तः पुरातनः ।\\nभक्तोऽसि मे सखा चेति रहस्यं ह्येतदुत्तमम् ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nsa evāyaṃ mayā te 'dya yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ\\nbhakto 'si me sakhā ceti rahasyaṃ hy etad uttamam","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: This same primeval yoga — that most ancient pathway to God — I now reveal to you today, because you are My devoted lover and My intimate friend.

He says: 'You are My bhakta and My sakhā — My devotee AND My friend.' This double relationship is extraordinarily rare. To be a devotee without friendship is to remain at a respectful distance. To be a friend without devotion risks taking God for granted. But Arjuna had both — and that is why he received what Vivasvat, Manu, and Ikshvaku received in the dawn of creation. The uttama rahasya — the supreme secret — is not a formula or a technique. It is the living relationship between the human soul and its divine source. Beta, the Lord is telling each one of us through Arjuna: when you approach with both love and intimacy, when you neither worship from afar nor forget the sacred nature of the bond — then the highest knowledge flows freely. That is why you must cultivate both bhakti and sakhya.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse reveals the criterion for receiving the highest knowledge — not caste, not scholarship, not even austerity alone, but bhakti combined with sakhya. Bhakto 'si me sakhā ceti — 'you are my devotee and my friend.' These two together constitute the adhikāra, the qualification. From the Vedantic standpoint, bhakti dissolves the ego's resistance and sakhya indicates the non-dual intimacy where the distinction between knower and the known begins to thin. The Lord calls this rahasya uttamam — the supreme secret. In Vedanta, 'secret' (rahasya) does not mean withheld; it means that without inner preparation, the ears hear the words but the meaning does not penetrate. This is why the Upanishads were traditionally transmitted in araṇya, in forest solitude, from teacher to intimate student. The Gita is the Upanishadic teaching brought to the battlefield of life.","yogananda":"The qualification for receiving God's highest teaching is exactly as stated: the disciple must be both bhakta — a devotee whose heart is surrendered — and sakhā — a true friend who meets the Guru-God in the reciprocity of divine love. This double qualification corresponds to two stages of inner development. Bhakti represents the devotional approach, the opening of the heart. Sakhya represents the more advanced state of fearless, intimate God-communion — the stage that great masters like Saint Francis and Ramakrishna achieved. The 'supreme secret' (rahasya uttamam) is the science of Self-realization through Kriya Yoga, which can only be transmitted when the disciple's consciousness is sufficiently refined by love and inner attunement. Krishna's words here are eternally personal — addressed to every soul who has truly prepared itself through devotion.","goyandka":"The Lord here explains the specific reason Arjuna deserves to receive this ancient and supreme teaching now. Two qualifications are cited: bhakti (devotion) and sakhya (friendship). The Gita Press commentators emphasize that these two together represent the fullness of the bhakta-Bhagavat relationship — complete surrender combined with loving intimacy. The teaching is called rahasya, a secret — not because it is withheld from the public, for the Gita is openly available — but because its deepest import can only be grasped by one whose mind and heart are properly prepared. Uttamam, 'supreme,' distinguishes this yoga from all lesser sciences. The repetition of 'this same yoga' (sa evāyam) affirms continuity with what was taught at creation's dawn, establishing the Gita's teaching as the primordial sanātana dharma, not a new doctrine."}},{"verse":4,"sanskrit":"अर्जुन उवाच ।\\nअपरं भवतो जन्म परं जन्म विवस्वतः ।\\nकथमेतद्विजानीयां त्वमादौ प्रोक्तवानिति ॥","transliteration":"arjuna uvāca\\naparaṃ bhavato janma paraṃ janma vivasvataḥ\\nkatham etad vijānīyāṃ tvam ādau proktavān iti","translation":"Arjuna said: Yet Your birth in this mortal world is but recent, while Vivasvat, the sun-god, was born in the immeasurable depths of the past.

He does not pretend to understand what he does not understand. He does not nod his head and move on. He stops and asks: 'But Krishna, You were born after Vivasvat — how could You have taught him?' Beta, this is not doubt born of disrespect. This is the sincere puzzlement that opens the door to the most profound teaching. Notice that Arjuna calls the Lord 'bhavataḥ' — using the respectful form even as he questions. The great student questions with reverence. And it is precisely this honest, respectful questioning that draws from the Lord the magnificent revelation of the avatāra doctrine and the nature of divine birth that follows in verses 5-9. Never be afraid to ask the sincere question.","sarvapriyananda":"Arjuna's question is philosophically acute. He identifies the apparent contradiction perfectly: aparaṃ bhavato janma — your birth is recent; paraṃ janma vivasvataḥ — Vivasvat's birth is ancient. From the empirical standpoint of time and history, this is irreconcilable. Arjuna is operating within the framework of conventional reality where every birth is a new beginning and where 'you' now is different from 'you' then. But the Lord's answer — beginning in verse 5 — will explode this framework entirely. The concept of the eternal ātman, unbound by any single birth, is the answer. This verse thus serves as the perfect jijñāsā — sincere spiritual inquiry — which is the essential starting point for Vedantic teaching. The tradition holds: only the question born of genuine perplexity can receive the answer that transforms.","yogananda":"Arjuna here voices the confusion of every soul still identified with the body: how can this man before me be the same being who taught Vivasvat at the dawn of time? The question reflects the limitation of body-bound consciousness, which can only perceive the external form and the current birth. Arjuna is not being skeptical — he is being honest about the limit of his current perception. This is the sincere devotee's inquiry, not the skeptic's challenge. Great masters through the ages have faced the same bewilderment from their disciples: 'But you were born just recently — how can you claim to be the eternal guru?' The answer, which Krishna is about to give, is one of the most liberating truths in all spiritual literature: the real Self was never born and never dies, and remembers all its apparent births.","goyandka":"Arjuna's question is marked by respectful perplexity — katham etad vijānīyām, 'how am I to understand this?' He uses bhavataḥ, the deferential second person, showing that this is not a challenge but a genuine seeker's inquiry. The Gita Press commentators point out the precision of the contrast: aparam (recent) versus param (ancient/prior). Arjuna's logic is sound within the boundaries of conventional understanding: Krishna's physical birth in the Dvāpara Yuga was well known and recent; Vivasvat belongs to the earliest age. This intellectual knot must be cut — and it is cut by the Lord's revelation of His transcendent nature beginning in the next verse. Such sincere śiṣya-praśna, the disciple's question, is the very mechanism by which the Gita's greatest teachings are drawn out."}},{"verse":5,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nबहूनि मे व्यतीतानि जन्मानि तव चार्जुन ।\\nतान्यहं वेद सर्वाणि न त्वं वेत्थ परन्तप ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nbahūni me vyatītāni janmāni tava cārjuna\\ntāny ahaṃ veda sarvāṇi na tvaṃ vettha paran-tapa","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Many are the incarnations through which both you and I have passed, O Arjuna.

The Lord does not say 'I am eternal and you are limited' in a dismissive way. He says 'both you and I have had many births' — He places Himself alongside Arjuna first, then gently reveals the difference: I know them all; you do not yet know. This is the tenderness of a true guru. He does not shame the student for not knowing. He acknowledges the shared journey first, then points to the asymmetry that exists for now — because it is only 'for now.' Arjuna too will eventually know. The entire Gita is the process of Arjuna recovering his divine vision. Beta, this verse contains a profound comfort: you have lived before, you will live again — and through the grace of the Lord, you too can recover the memory of your immortal Self that stands behind all these appearances.","sarvapriyananda":"In this pivotal verse the Lord introduces two critical Vedantic truths simultaneously. First: the ātman transmigrates — bahūni janmāni, many births have passed — this is the doctrine of rebirth (punarjanma) that is foundational to Vedanta. Second: the Lord's knowledge is not accumulated in time but is intrinsic to His nature. Aham veda sarvāṇi — I know all of them — this is the sarvajñatā, the omniscience, of the Absolute. The verb veda, from √vid, is used in the perfect tense but carries a timeless meaning — I have always known and do know. Arjuna's not-knowing is the condition of jīva-consciousness still under the veil of māyā. The entire spiritual path is the removal of this veil: from vettha-lessness to the fullness of veda, from forgetting to remembering the eternal Self.","yogananda":"Here Krishna reveals one of the most important truths of all metaphysics: the soul's journey through many lives. 'Many are My births that have passed, and yours also' — this is the affirmation of reincarnation, which the divine masters of East and West have consistently taught. The crucial distinction: 'I know them all; you do not know them.' The difference between an avatāra and an ordinary soul is not that one is reborn and the other is not — both take many forms. The difference is in the quality of consciousness: the avatāra retains full divine awareness across all incarnations; the unillumined soul is veiled by māyā and forgets its past. Through Kriya Yoga and deep meditation, the devotee can gradually recover this memory — this is called jāti-smara in the yogic tradition — and ultimately know the Self that was never born.","goyandka":"The Lord here directly addresses Arjuna's question about past births by affirming that both He and Arjuna have passed through many incarnations. The critical distinction is in the quality of knowing: tāny ahaṃ veda sarvāṇi — I know all of them — while na tvaṃ vettha — you do not know yours. The Gita Press commentary notes that this does not mean Arjuna is spiritually inferior in an absolute sense — it means that in his present state, the screen of māyā has covered his trans-incarnational memory. The Lord's knowledge is nitya (eternal) and not subject to such obscuration. This verse establishes the ontological difference between the Paramātman who takes voluntary birth and the jīvātman who is bound by karma and saṃskāra into repeated embodiment. It is this difference that the next verse will elaborate through the doctrine of divine self-manifestation."}},{"verse":6,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nअजोऽपि सन्नव्ययात्मा भूतानामीश्वरोऽपि सन् ।\\nप्रकृतिं स्वामधिष्ठाय सम्भवाम्यात्ममायया ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\najo 'pi sann avyayātmā bhūtānām īśvaro 'pi san\\nprakṛtiṃ svām adhiṣṭhāya sambhavāmy ātma-māyayā","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Though I am the Unborn, the ever-imperishable Spirit, the Supreme Lord and Soul of all creation — yet by sovereign command of My own divine creative power, I willingly clothe Myself in the garments of Nature and descend into apparent birth.

The Lord is saying: I am the Unborn — yet I am born. I am the Imperishable — yet I take on a perishable form. I am the Lord of all — yet I appear as a helpless child in Devaki's womb. How? Through ātma-māyā — My own divine creative power. Beta, this is not contradiction; this is the infinite freedom of God. A flame can light a thousand candles without itself being diminished. An ocean can form a million waves without ceasing to be the ocean. When the Infinite chooses to appear as the finite, it does so without actually becoming limited — it remains infinite throughout. This is why Krishna could be simultaneously a child in Vrindavan, a statesman in Dwarka, and the eternal Brahman beyond all form. The divine mystery of the avatāra is that God plays in the world while remaining untouched by it.","sarvapriyananda":"This is arguably the most philosophically dense verse of Chapter 4. The Lord enumerates three transcendent attributes — ajaḥ (unborn), avyayātmā (imperishable Self), and īśvara (Lord of all) — and then immediately resolves the paradox of His apparent birth by citing ātma-māyā, His own divine creative power. From the Advaita Vedanta perspective, this verse describes the mystery of saguna Brahman: the Absolute, which is in its ultimate nature attributeless (nirguṇa), voluntarily assumes the appearance of personal divine manifestation through its own śakti (power). This is not the bondage of karma-driven birth; it is the sovereign freedom (svā-tantratā) of the Supreme. The word svām in prakṛtiṃ svām — 'My own Prakriti' — is crucial: He presides over nature; nature does not preside over Him. This is the difference between avatāra and jīva.","yogananda":"The great paradox of incarnation is here perfectly stated: ajo 'pi — 'though unborn.' The eternal Christ Consciousness, the Kutastha Chaitanya, is never born and never dies. Yet it appears in human form through ātma-māyā — its own divine creative energy, the same cosmic energy that Yogananda identified as Om, the Holy Ghost, the creative vibration of God. When a master of the highest order incarnates, he does so not under karmic compulsion but by sovereign choice. He 'controls his own Prakriti' — he enters the stream of nature from above, not from below. This is the difference between the avatāra and the ordinary soul: both appear in human form, but one comes as the ocean appearing as a wave, while the other is a wave that has not yet remembered it is the ocean. Meditation on this verse reveals the innermost secret of divine incarnation.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary emphasizes the four-fold contrast in this verse: the Lord is ajaḥ — yet He appears to be born; He is avyayātmā — yet He takes on a body that appears subject to time; He is bhūtānām īśvaraḥ — yet He appears as a human being within creation; He controls His own Prakriti — yet He appears to act within nature's laws. All four apparent contradictions are resolved by the single phrase ātma-māyayā — by His own divine Māyā, His sovereign creative potency. This māyā of the Lord is not the same as the māyā that binds jīvas — it is the Lord's free divine will operating through His higher Prakriti (daivī māyā). The Gita Press notes that this verse is the foundation of the entire avatāra doctrine: God does not need to be 'born' in the ordinary sense, but graciously appears in a form accessible to human devotion and understanding."}},{"verse":7,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nयदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत ।\\nअभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nyadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata\\nabhyutthānam adharmasya tadātmānaṃ sṛjāmy aham","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Whenever the light of righteousness grows faint in human hearts, O Bharata, and the darkness of unrighteousness surges like a rising tide — in that very hour I descend.

Feel the rhythm of these words, beta. The Lord is not speaking of a single event in history but of a recurring divine pattern. Whenever the world tilts too far from dharma — whenever adharma begins its abhyutthāna, its forceful rising — the Lord manifests. This is the eternal promise. But do not wait for the Lord only on the grand cosmic scale. This verse operates in your individual life too. Whenever your inner dharma — your true nature as a child of God — begins to fade, whenever the forces of tamasic ignorance and rajasic passion begin to overwhelm your inner life, the Lord stirs within you. He manifests as a sudden clarity, a chance meeting with a saint, a scripture that speaks directly to your condition. 'I manifest Myself' — always, in every age, in every sincere heart that yearns for Truth.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse, along with verse 8, forms one of the most beloved couplets in all Indian literature. Dharmasya glāniḥ — the word glāni is particularly revealing. It does not mean dharma is destroyed or abolished — it means it becomes weary, enfeebled, loses its vitality while still formally persisting. This is the most dangerous phase: when the external forms of religion continue but the living inner realization has drained away. Abhyutthānam adharmasya — adharma does not merely rise gradually but 'rises up,' abhyutthāna suggesting an assertive, forceful ascendancy. The Lord's response is ātmānaṃ sṛjāmy aham — I project Myself, I manifest. The verb √sṛj (to create/emit) is significant: the avatāra is a divine projection of Brahman, not a creation from outside. The source of all avatāras is the one Consciousness.","yogananda":"In the annals of world history, the great divine incarnations have appeared precisely at the moments of deepest darkness — Buddha at a time of spiritual formalism, Christ at an age of Roman materialism and Jewish legalism, Ramakrishna and Yogananda's lineage at the dawn of the modern scientific age when materialism threatened to extinguish the spiritual instinct. This is the divine law: yadā yadā — whenever dharma declines. Glāni (decline) is not the same as destruction. Often dharma's outer forms remain while its inner fire is extinguished — and this is when the Lord manifests most urgently. In the inner life, this verse means: whenever your soul's connection to the Divine weakens, whenever the 'adharma' of distraction and ego-assertion rises up, God responds — through the guru, through inspiration, through the inner voice of conscience.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary notes that yadā yadā (whenever, at whatever time) establishes this as a universal and repeating law, not a one-time event. The Lord intervenes not when dharma is completely destroyed — for that would be too late — but when glāni occurs, when it begins to fade and lose its authority, simultaneously with adharma's abhyutthāna, its forceful rising. The two conditions together trigger the divine response: ātmānaṃ sṛjāmy aham — 'I manifest Myself.' The word sṛjāmi (I project/emit) rather than janāmi (I am born) is significant in Sanskrit — it indicates that the Lord is not passively born but actively projects Himself into manifestation through His own sovereign will. This verse establishes that avatāras appear in a cyclical pattern throughout cosmic time, ensuring the continuity of dharma across all ages."}},{"verse":8,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nपरित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम् ।\\nधर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय सम्भवामि युगे युगे ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nparitrāṇāya sādhūnāṃ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām\\ndharma-saṃsthāpanārthāya sambhavāmi yuge yuge","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: To shelter the pure-hearted devotees who walk the path of the Spirit, to dissolve the power of those forces that violate divine order, and to raise again the eternal pillars of righteousness — I incarnate upon this earth, age after age, life after life, in fulfillment of God's eternal vow to His children.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch04/verse_04_08.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"परित्राणाय","transliteration":"paritrāṇāya","root":"pari + √trā (to protect / to save / to rescue thoroughly)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, dative, singular (purpose dative)","meaning":"for the complete protection / for the deliverance / for the saving — of the sādhus"},{"word":"साधूनाम्","transliteration":"sādhūnām","root":"√sādh (to accomplish / to be virtuous) — sādhu: the good person","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, genitive, plural","meaning":"of the good / of the virtuous / of the righteous — saints, sages, and genuine seekers"},{"word":"दुष्कृताम्","transliteration":"duṣkṛtām","root":"duṣ + √kṛ (to do evil / to act wickedly) — duṣkṛt: evildoer","grammatical_form":"Noun/adjective compound, masculine, genitive, plural","meaning":"of the evildoers / of the wicked / of those whose acts are harmful"},{"word":"संस्थापनार्थाय","transliteration":"saṃsthāpanārthāya","root":"sam + √sthā + pana (action noun) + artha (purpose) — firm re-establishment","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, dative, singular (purpose)","meaning":"for the purpose of firmly re-establishing / re-founding / restoring dharma"},{"word":"युगे युगे","transliteration":"yuge yuge","root":"yuga (an age / a cosmic era — from √yuj, to join)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, locative, singular — repeated for distributive sense","meaning":"age after age / in every yuga / from era to era — the eternal recurrence"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Three purposes — three acts of divine love. First: paritrāṇāya sādhūnām — the protection of the good. The sādhus, the seekers, the pure-hearted ones — they are never abandoned. When the world becomes too hostile for the genuine spiritual life, the Lord comes. Second: vināśāya duṣkṛtām — the dissolution of those whose actions are destructive. Note, beta, that it says duṣkṛtām — 'of the evil-doers,' not 'of the evil people.' Even here there is compassion: it is the evil actions, the destructive patterns, that must be ended. Third: dharma-saṃsthāpanārthāya — for the firm RE-establishment of dharma. Saṃsthāpana means to place firmly, to anchor securely. And then the crowning phrase: yuge yuge — age after age. Not once. Not twice. Always. This is the Lord's eternal vow. Carry this verse in your heart and you will never despair of the world.","sarvapriyananda":"The three purposes articulated here follow a beautiful inner logic. Paritrāṇāya sādhūnām — the sādhus represent dharma's living embodiment; protecting them is protecting dharma's vital force. Vināśāya duṣkṛtām — the evildoers represent dharma's active opposition; their dissolution removes the obstacle. Dharma-saṃsthāpanārthāya — once the negative forces are neutralized and the positive forces protected, the positive re-establishment becomes possible. This is cosmic governance. From a Vedantic standpoint, the Lord who does all this is the one Consciousness that underlies all seeming conflict. Yuge yuge — in every age — is a statement of eternal divine oversight. The Gita assures us: this universe is not abandoned to chaos. There is a governing Consciousness, and It responds to the collective dharmic condition of humanity.","yogananda":"Yuge yuge — 'age after age' — is the cosmic heartbeat of divine intervention. This verse, along with verse 7, constitutes what Yogananda called 'God's eternal promise to humanity.' The three purposes correspond to three aspects of the divine work: the liberating function (protection of the good), the purifying function (dissolution of destructive forces), and the re-creative function (re-establishment of cosmic order). In the personal life of the devotee, this same threefold process operates through the guru's grace: the guru protects the student's spiritual sensitivity (sādhu-aspect), purifies the ego-tendencies that oppose growth (duṣkṛt-aspect), and gradually re-establishes the soul's native dharma of God-consciousness. The avatāra is thus not only a cosmic event but a personal, interior one — occurring whenever God's presence reasserts itself in the prepared heart.","goyandka":"This verse completes the doctrine introduced in verse 7 by specifying the three-fold divine purpose of the avatāra. The Gita Press commentary emphasizes that these three are not separate missions but aspects of a single unified purpose: the restoration of the cosmic order. Paritrāṇa (thorough protection, literally 'carrying safely across') for the sādhus; vināśa (complete destruction) for those whose actions are destructive — not their souls, which are eternal, but the harmful patterns and the adharmic order they sustain; and dharma-saṃsthāpana (firm re-establishment) as the positive constructive outcome. Yuge yuge — the locative repetition in Sanskrit indicates 'in each and every yuga without exception.' This verse has given extraordinary comfort to generations of Bhārata through dark periods of history, assuring them that the divine protection and the re-establishment of dharma is a cosmic inevitability."}},{"verse":9,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nजन्म कर्म च मे दिव्यमेवं यो वेत्ति तत्त्वतः ।\\nत्यक्त्वा देहं पुनर्जन्म नैति मामेति सोऽर्जुन ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\njanma karma ca me divyam evaṃ yo vetti tattvataḥ\\ntyaktvā dehaṃ punar janma naiti mām eti so 'rjuna","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: O Arjuna, the devotee who perceives in deep inner realization the divine mystery of My incarnation and the transcendent nature of My actions — that liberated soul, upon leaving the body, is freed at last from the wheel of birth and death and returns to Me, merging into the infinite ocean of Spirit from which all souls originally arose.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch04/verse_04_09.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"दिव्यम्","transliteration":"divyam","root":"div (heaven / light / the divine realm) + suffix -ya","grammatical_form":"Adjective, neuter, accusative, singular","meaning":"divine / transcendent / not of this earthly nature — applied to both birth and action"},{"word":"तत्त्वतः","transliteration":"tattvataḥ","root":"tat + tva (that-ness / suchness / essential reality) + ablative -taḥ","grammatical_form":"Adverb, ablative of manner (indeclinable in use)","meaning":"in truth / in essential reality / according to the true nature of things"},{"word":"त्यक्त्वा","transliteration":"tyaktvā","root":"√tyaj (to leave / to abandon / to relinquish)","grammatical_form":"Absolutive (gerund), indeclinable","meaning":"having left / upon leaving / after abandoning — the body at death"},{"word":"पुनर्जन्म","transliteration":"punar janma","root":"punar (again) + √jan (to be born) — janma (birth)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, accusative, singular","meaning":"rebirth / reincarnation — being born again into another body"},{"word":"नैति","transliteration":"naiti","root":"na + √i (to go) — na eti: does not go","grammatical_form":"Verb, present tense, 3rd person, singular — negated","meaning":"does not go to / does not attain — i.e., does not return to rebirth"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Beta, listen carefully — this is the great promise. The Lord says: whoever truly understands the divine nature of My birth and actions — tattvataḥ, in their essential reality — that person is liberated. They will not be reborn. They will come to Me. What does it mean to 'truly know'? It does not mean merely reading or memorizing. Tattvataḥ means understanding at the level of being, not just the level of thought. When you genuinely grasp that the Lord's birth is not like a human birth driven by karma, that His actions are not bound by personal desire — when this truth penetrates from the mind into the heart — something in you is freed. The knowledge of the divine nature of the avatāra is itself liberating because it begins to reveal to you your own divine nature. You are not this body either. You too were never really born. Mām eti — 'he comes to Me' — this is moksha, and it begins with this understanding.","sarvapriyananda":"The liberating power of jñāna — true knowledge — is nowhere stated more precisely than here. Yo vetti tattvataḥ — whoever knows in essential truth — the 'knowing' here is not intellectual comprehension but tattva-darśana, the direct vision of the essential nature of reality. What must be known? The divyatā of the Lord's janma and karma — that His birth is not karma-driven and His action is not ego-motivated. This comprehension shatters the identification with one's own karma-driven birth and action. The one who truly knows this about the Lord simultaneously understands it about the ātman — for the Lord's nature and the ātman's ultimate nature are not different. Tyaktvā dehaṃ punar janma naiti — upon leaving the body, no more rebirth. This is mukti, liberation: not the destruction of individuality but the end of the compulsive cycle of karma-bound embodiment.","yogananda":"This is one of the most spiritually potent verses in the Gita: the promise of liberation through understanding the divine nature of the avatāra's birth and action. But 'understanding' here means far more than intellectual recognition. Tattvataḥ — 'according to essential truth' — means the transformative realization that comes through deep meditation, not from reading alone. When the devotee truly perceives that Krishna-Christ Consciousness is not limited by any birth or any physical action, this perception dissolves the devotee's own identification with the body. Mām eti so 'rjuna — 'he comes to Me.' This mergence with God-consciousness is the ultimate goal of all yoga. Yogananda taught that realizing the divinity of the guru's life and actions — seeing through the outer form to the Infinite behind it — is one of the most direct paths to liberation that the devotee can walk.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary presents this verse as the culminating promise of the avatāra doctrine established in verses 6-8. Divyam janma — the Lord's birth is divine (not karma-compelled); divyam karma — His actions are divine (not ego-motivated). He who understands this tattvataḥ — according to the essential reality — achieves the supreme result: punar janma naiti, no rebirth, and mām eti, attainment of the Lord. The word 'tattvataḥ' is technically significant: the Gita Press notes that mere theoretical knowledge (parokṣa jñāna) is insufficient; what is required is aparokṣa jñāna — direct, immediate, personal realization. This verse confirms a central Vaishnava principle: sākṣāt-kāra of the Lord's divine nature is itself the liberating act. The devotee who truly perceives this is released from the cycle of saṃsāra."}},{"verse":10,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nवीतरागभयक्रोधा मन्मया मामुपाश्रिताः ।\\nबहवो ज्ञानतपसा पूता मद्भावमागताः ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nvīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhā man-mayā mām upāśritāḥ\\nbahavo jñāna-tapasā pūtā mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Liberated from the chains of desire, fear, and anger — their hearts dissolved completely in Me, their souls taking refuge in My love alone — many luminous souls have been utterly purified by the sacred fire of Self-inquiry and wisdom.

Bahavaḥ — 'many' have attained. The Lord does not say 'a few rare ones' or 'only those with impossible qualification.' Many. Throughout the ages, countless souls have made this journey, have arrived at mad-bhāvam — the very state of being of God. What was their path? Three freedoms and two positive engagements. Free from rāga (attachment, the pull of craving), bhaya (fear, the push of aversion), and krodha (anger, the flare-up when desires are thwarted) — notice these three cover the entire field of ego-reactivity. And then: man-mayā, absorbed in the Lord, and mām upāśritāḥ, taking complete refuge. Beta, you don't need to extinguish these faults by willpower alone. Take refuge in the Lord — let His love and presence fill your consciousness — and rāga, bhaya, and krodha naturally subside. Jñāna-tapas, the austerity of knowledge, does its purifying work through this loving surrender.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is a remarkable encapsulation of the entire spiritual path and its attainable goal. The qualification: vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhāḥ — the three psychological obstacles that Vedanta identifies as the root manifestations of the ego. Rāga (desire-attachment) pulls the mind toward the world; bhaya (fear) pushes it away in avoidance; krodha (anger) erupts when rāga is thwarted. When these three thin out, consciousness becomes available for God. Man-mayā — 'My-pervaded' — is the positive alternative to world-pervaded consciousness. Mām upāśritāḥ — 'taking complete refuge in Me' — is the surrendering of the separate-self illusion to the source. Jñāna-tapas is significant: not merely jñāna (knowledge) alone, but jñāna as tapas — as a transforming, purifying heat. Mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ — 'they have come to My state.' This is Advaita's ultimate statement: not proximity to God, but identity.","yogananda":"In this verse the Lord points to the practical psychology of liberation and names its crown: mad-bhāvam, the divine state of God-consciousness itself. Vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhāḥ — detachment from craving (rāga), freedom from the fear-reflex (bhaya), and dissolution of reactive anger (krodha) — these three together describe what Yogananda called 'the even mind,' the state of equanimity that makes deep meditation possible. Man-mayā — consciousness saturated with God — is achieved through continuous practice of the presence of God, whether in formal meditation or in daily life. Jñāna-tapasā: the heat (tapas) of Self-inquiry and wisdom burns away the dross of ego-identification, purifying (pūtāḥ) the consciousness. And the goal — mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ — many have reached it. Not as a remote possibility but as a confirmed fact of spiritual history. You too can reach it.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary treats this verse as a historical testimony to the efficacy of the path described throughout the first ten verses of Chapter 4. Bahavaḥ, 'many,' refers to the long lineage of sādhus and muktas across all ages who have walked this path and arrived. The verse gives a precise map of the inner transformation: the threefold purification (from rāga, bhaya, krodha), the twofold positive orientation (man-mayā — filled with God; upāśritāḥ — taking refuge), and the purifying instrument (jñāna-tapas — the austere discipline of wisdom). The compound jñāna-tapas is particularly significant: here jñāna is not merely doctrinal knowledge but the intense living inquiry that generates an inner heat (tapas) capable of burning away karmic impurities. Mad-bhāvam āgatāḥ — 'they have attained My bhāva' — means they have realized the essential divine nature that is their own truest Self."}},{"verse":11,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम् ।\\nमम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nye yathā māṃ prapadyante tāṃs tathaiva bhajāmy aham\\nmama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: In whatever way a soul approaches Me — whether through devotion, through wisdom, through selfless service, or through the path of yoga — in precisely that way do I reveal Myself and respond.

Yet all these paths are ultimately His own paths — mama vartmānuvartante — because there is nothing outside of Him. The universe of seekers is His own manifestation, following His own movement. The Lord does not show favoritism; He mirrors perfectly the sincerity and orientation of each soul.","yogananda":"In the inner science of yoga, this verse reveals that God responds to the soul's exact frequency of aspiration. Whatever quality of consciousness — devotion, inquiry, will, or love — with which the devotee approaches the Infinite, that same quality is amplified and returned. It is the divine law of resonance. Those who approach God through the heart receive divine love; those who approach through the intellect receive illuminating wisdom; those who approach through will receive strength. All paths are His paths because the entire cosmos is His body. The devotee is encouraged: approach with sincerity in any way, and you will find the Lord meeting you at your own door.","goyandka":"This verse establishes the universal sovereignty of the Lord over all modes of worship and approach. The phrase ye yathā māṃ prapadyante — 'in whatever way they take refuge in Me' — makes clear that the Lord is accessible through any sincere path.

We pray for rain, for wealth, for children, for victory. And those deities, being aspects of Bhagwan's own power, do grant these things, and quickly too. The human world is the realm of action and reaction; karma bears its fruit here and now. But Bhagwan is not condemning this. He is observing it with compassion. He is saying: yes, the world of desire leads to the gods, and the gods deliver. But I am inviting you to something higher — to Me, the source of all gods. That invitation is always open.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents a crucial philosophical distinction. The worshippers of the devas — cosmic powers governing natural forces — obtain results quickly because the devas operate within the phenomenal realm of karma-phala, the fruit of action. This is entirely consistent with the Vedic worldview where different deities govern different domains. The Lord is not disparaging such worship; He is contextualizing it. Rapid, tangible, worldly results are the province of deva worship and karma-jā siddhi. But the Lord of verse 11 is pointing beyond this to a liberation that transcends the law of result altogether. The contrast with mokṣa is implicit: one must choose between quick fruit and ultimate freedom.","yogananda":"In the metaphysical reading, the 'gods' are the divine forces or cosmic principles — light, energy, intelligence — that govern natural and psychic laws. Those who approach life with desire for specific outcomes, attuned to these powers, do receive rapid results. The human body-mind, with its focused will and directed energy, is uniquely suited for quick karma-jā siddhi. Yet Yogananda taught that this remains within the wheel of cause and effect, binding the soul further. The higher path is to offer all action to the Supreme — then even action becomes liberation. The verse is not a prohibition but a pointing: see the difference between the swift fruit of desire and the timeless fruit of Self-realization.","goyandka":"The Lord here describes the fruit of sakāma karma — action motivated by desire — contrasted with niṣkāma karma expounded throughout the Gita. Worship of the devatās, the presiding cosmic forces, yields fruit that is rapid in the human sphere because the material plane is their domain. The word iha, 'here in this world,' is significant — it localizes the reward to the mortal realm. Karma-jā siddhi is real and legitimate within its domain, but it is confined to the transient. The sincere student should observe that the Lord presents this not with condemnation but as a description of lower aspiration, inviting elevation toward the eternal. One who understands this chooses worship of the Supreme over worship of the partial."}},{"verse":13,"sanskrit":"चातुर्वर्ण्यं मया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः ।\\nतस्य कर्तारमपि मां विद्ध्यकर्तारमव्ययम् ॥","transliteration":"cātur-varṇyaṃ mayā sṛṣṭaṃ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ\\ntasya kartāram api māṃ viddhy akartāram avyayam","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: The fourfold order of human society was created by Me according to the soul's inherent qualities and the work those qualities naturally draw forth.

The Lord did not create a system of birth-based privilege. He created a natural order of guṇa and karma — the qualities a soul carries and the work it is drawn toward. A brāhmaṇa is one whose nature is contemplation and teaching; a kṣatriya is one whose nature is courage and protection — and this can be any person, regardless of birth. And then comes the profound mystery: even as creator of this order, He is akartā, the non-doer. Because His nature is beyond all doing, beyond all form. He creates through His very being, not through effort. We are invited to become like Him — act fully, but be untouched.","sarvapriyananda":"The profound paradox of this verse is the simultaneous assertion: kartāram — 'I am the creator' — and akartāram — 'I am the non-doer.' This is the Advaita position on divine causation. Brahman is the material and efficient cause of the universe, yet Brahman undergoes no modification, no doing. The fourfold varṇa system is described as guṇa-karma based — it is functional, not ontological. It arises from the distribution of the three guṇas — sattva, rajas, tamas — in combination with one's natural action. The immutable (avyayam) nature of the Lord means that creation does not add to or subtract from Him. This is why the jñānī, who identifies with the Self rather than the body-mind, also becomes akartā in the midst of action.","yogananda":"The four varṇas, Yogananda taught, are not social castes fixed by birth but spiritual classifications arising from the soul's current state of unfoldment. The brāhmaṇa-nature is dominantly sattvic; the kṣatriya-nature is rajasic tempered by sattva; the vaiśya-nature is rajasic; and the śūdra-nature is tamasic. Each person embodies a blend, and the spiritual life is the progressive movement from tamas toward sattva, from śūdra-consciousness to brāhmaṇa-consciousness. The deeper mystery is that the Lord, though the source of this cosmic drama, remains akartā — the witness-Self, the unchanging screen upon which all activity plays. This is the ideal the yogi aspires to: engaged in life, yet the eternal witness.","goyandka":"The Lord here establishes two vital truths. First, the varṇa system is guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ — rooted in the natural disposition (guṇa) and characteristic action (karma) of the individual, not in birth alone. This understanding corrects a widespread misreading of the Vedic social order. Second, and more philosophically profound, is the declaration: though I am the kartā — the efficient cause — know me as akartā, the non-doer. This is because the Lord acts through His māyā-śakti, through Prakṛti, while the Puruṣa — the Supreme Consciousness — remains eternally unchanged. The word avyayam, 'imperishable,' reinforces that no action, however vast, touches the essence of the Lord. This is the model for all karma-yoga: act, but know yourself as the witness."}},{"verse":14,"sanskrit":"न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा ।\\nइति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बध्यते ॥","transliteration":"na māṃ karmāṇi limpanti na me karma-phale spṛhā\\niti māṃ yo 'bhijānāti karmabhir na sa badhyate","translation":"No action leaves a stain upon My eternal Spirit, nor does any craving for the fruit of deeds arise within Me — for I am ever established in the fullness of God.

He would say: even the Lord — who creates, sustains, and dissolves everything — is not stained by any of it. There is no karma-phala-spṛhā in Him, no hunger for results. He acts from fullness, not from lack. And the one who truly knows this — who absorbs this understanding into the marrow of their being — walks free. Not free from action, but free in action. This knowledge is not intellectual information; it is a living recognition that transforms how you act, why you act, and whether action touches your deepest self.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the philosophical kernel of karma-yoga. The Lord states the two conditions of His freedom: absence of taint (na limpanti) and absence of desire (na spṛhā). Taint comes from identification with the ego-doer; desire comes from identifying the self with outcomes. The Lord, as pure Consciousness, neither identifies with the instrumentality of action nor with its results. The liberating corollary: yo māṃ abhijānāti — he who knows this about Me — knows the same about the Self, for the ātman is non-different from Brahman. Such a one acts through the body-mind but as the witness. Therefore karmabhir na sa badhyate — action cannot bind what has never identified with doing.","yogananda":"The Lord here reveals the secret of divine action. He acts — creating the cosmos, sustaining worlds, dissolving forms — yet na limpanti, nothing clings. It is like sunlight touching everything without becoming anything it touches. Yogananda described this as the consciousness of the jīvanmukta, the liberated soul. Such a one may be intensely active in the world — running ashrams, writing books, serving thousands — yet inwardly there is not a ripple of ego-involvement. No spṛhā, no craving for the outcome. This is not indifference; it is perfect love without possession. The seeker who understands this begins to practice exactly this: let every action be an offering, let every result return to God.","goyandka":"Two qualities are identified here as the basis of the Lord's freedom from karma-bondage. First, na māṃ karmāṇi limpanti — actions do not adhere to Him — because He has no ahaṅkāra, no ego-sense of 'I am the doer.' Second, na me karma-phale spṛhā — He has no craving for results — because He is pūrṇa, ever-complete, desiring nothing. These two — non-doership and desirelessness — are precisely what karma-yoga prescribes for the sādhaka. The verse closes with the liberating promise: iti māṃ yo 'bhijānāti karmabhir na sa badhyate. This jñāna — knowing the Lord's true nature — is itself liberating. It is not mere theological belief but a recognition that transforms one's entire relationship with action."}},{"verse":15,"sanskrit":"एवं ज्ञात्वा कृतं कर्म पूर्वैरपि मुमुक्षुभिः ।\\nकुरु कर्मैव तस्माद्वं पूर्वैः पूर्वतरं कृतम् ॥","transliteration":"evaṃ jñātvā kṛtaṃ karma pūrvair api mumukṣubhiḥ\\nkuru karmaiva tasmāt tvaṃ pūrvaiḥ pūrvataram kṛtam","translation":"Armed with this liberating wisdom, the great seekers of liberation in ages past performed their worldly duties with joyful, unattached hearts.

The rishis, the great sages of the ancient world, knew this truth — that action done without ego, without craving for results, does not bind — and they acted. Janaka ruled a kingdom. Vishwamitra fought wars. They acted! And they were free. So what excuse do we have, sitting quietly in our homes, worrying about getting entangled? Bhagwan says: tasmāt — therefore — do your work. Not as an escape into inaction, not as an excuse to renounce everything, but as an affirmation of the ancient wisdom path. The tradition carries the energy. Step into it.","sarvapriyananda":"The Lord grounds karma-yoga in the testimony of the tradition — the pūrvaiḥ mumukṣubhiḥ, the ancient seekers of liberation. This is an appeal to śruti and smṛti in living form: not just the scriptures but the lives of those who enacted the scriptures. The phrase pūrvaiḥ pūrvataram kṛtam has a beautiful recursive quality — 'as those of old did, who followed those older still.' It points to an unbroken lineage of engaged wisdom. The Advaita student learns: the appearance of action and the reality of non-doing are perfectly compatible. The ṛṣis lived this. Arjuna is called to live this. This is not philosophical speculation — it is a proven path.","yogananda":"This verse gives Arjuna — and all seekers — the gift of lineage and confidence. The great ones who came before, the mumukṣus — those burning for liberation — did not retreat from action. They embraced it with the knowledge of the non-doer self. Yogananda often invoked this principle: look at the masters, look at how they lived — with absolute engagement in their missions and absolute inner freedom. Sri Yukteswar, Lahiri Mahasaya — they worked constantly, yet were untouched. This is not abstract; it is biographical. The Lord says: they did it. Therefore you can do it. Trust the lineage. Enter the stream of the ancient wisdom and act.","goyandka":"The Lord here provides both philosophical grounding and practical encouragement. Evaṃ jñātvā — 'having known thus' — refers back to the jñāna of verse 14: the understanding that the Lord is akartā, non-doer, and that one who knows this is not bound. This knowledge was the fuel by which pūrva mumukṣus — ancient liberation-seekers — performed their duties. The command kuru karma — 'perform action' — is the Gita's central prescription. The phrase pūrvaiḥ pūrvataram kṛtam, 'done by the ancients of ancient times,' establishes the eternal validity of this path. The student is not being asked to innovate but to inherit — to receive the wisdom and the practice together as one living tradition."}},{"verse":16,"sanskrit":"किं कर्म किमकर्मेति कवयोऽप्यत्र मोहिताः ।\\nतत्ते कर्म प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात् ॥","transliteration":"kiṃ karma kim akarmeti kavayo 'py atra mohitāḥ\\ntat te karma pravakṣyāmi yaj jñātvā mokṣyase 'śubhāt","translation":"Even among the wise and learned, deep confusion clouds the true understanding of action and non-action.

If that is so, how much more so are we ordinary people. But this is not discouraging. It is actually deeply reassuring. Bhagwan Himself says: I will explain it to you. He is taking personal responsibility for our understanding. And then — what a promise — yaj jñātvā mokṣyase 'śubhāt: knowing this, you will be freed from evil. Not just confusion, not just sin — freed from all that is not auspicious in your life. This is the generosity of Bhagwan's teaching. He sets the bar — 'even the wise are confused' — and then says: but don't worry, I've got you.","sarvapriyananda":"The Lord's statement that even the kavayaḥ — the seers and the learned — are bewildered by the nature of action is not hyperbole. It is a precise philosophical statement. The question 'what is karma? what is akarma?' is not answerable by ordinary rational analysis. The confusion arises because karma operates on multiple levels simultaneously: the physical level of bodily movement, the subtle level of intention, and the transcendent level of Self-identification. The teaching to follow — beginning with verse 17 — will systematically address this. The promise is extraordinary: yaj jñātvā mokṣyase 'śubhāt — this jñāna is liberating jñāna, not merely informational but transformative, freeing from the entire mass of inauspiciousness.","yogananda":"The Lord here acknowledges the genuine profundity of the question. What is action? What is non-action? These seem simple, but at the deeper levels of consciousness they become bewildering. A saint may appear completely still in samādhi — is that action or inaction? A karma-yogi may be intensely active in service — is that binding or liberating? Yogananda taught that the answer lies in whether the ego is the agent. When the ego is absent, even the most intense activity is akarma — non-action. When the ego is present, even sitting still is karma — because the mind is spinning with desire and resistance. The Lord's promise to reveal this is an invitation into the deepest level of self-inquiry.","goyandka":"This verse serves as a pivotal transition in Chapter 4. The Lord acknowledges that the subject of karma, vikarma, and akarma is gahanā — deep and difficult (as the next verse states). Even men of learning — kavayaḥ — are mohitāḥ, led astray by their partial understanding. The Lord therefore steps forward as the supreme teacher: tat te karma pravakṣyāmi — 'that karma I shall declare to you.' The singular pronoun tat points to a specific, definitive teaching to come. The ultimate promise — mokṣyase 'śubhāt — liberation from inauspiciousness — encompasses all forms of bondage, from sinful action to subtle ego-entanglement. This is the highest guarantee a guru can give."}},{"verse":17,"sanskrit":"कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः ।\\nअकर्मणश्च बोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणो गतिः ॥","transliteration":"karmaṇo hy api boddhavyaṃ boddhavyaṃ ca vikarmaṇaḥ\\nakarmaṇaś ca boddhavyaṃ gahanā karmaṇo gatiḥ","translation":"One must understand the true nature of right action, the nature of wrong action that entangles the soul in karma, and the profound mystery of divine inaction — the activity of the free, witnessing Spirit that acts without acting.

Three worlds of understanding. Karma: action that is prescribed, that sustains and supports. Vikarma: action that is forbidden, that violates dharma and deepens bondage. Akarma: the inaction of the knower — not laziness, but the non-doing that lies within even the most intense action. Dada would say: we think we understand action because our bodies move. But we barely scratch the surface. Gahanā karmaṇo gatiḥ — the way of karma is deep, dense, like a thick forest where even the experienced can lose their way. This humility — this admission of depth — is what makes the Gita teacher different from all others. He does not simplify. He goes deep.","sarvapriyananda":"The triple structure of this verse — karma, vikarma, akarma — must be understood systematically. Karma refers to nitya-naimittika-karma: daily and occasional duties that one is enjoined to perform. Vikarma refers to niṣiddha-karma: actions prohibited by śāstra, actions that bind and degrade. Akarma refers to the transcendent non-doing of the Self — neither the bodily stillness of sleep nor the inactivity of the lazy person, but the utterly action-less nature of the witness-Self even while the body-mind acts. The exclamation gahanā karmaṇo gatiḥ — 'deep is the way of action' — is the Lord's own humility before the unfathomable complexity of dharmic life and the corresponding need for a true teacher.","yogananda":"In yogic understanding, karma encompasses more than visible action. It includes the subtle actions of thought, intention, and will. Vikarma is not merely ethically wrong conduct but any action performed with ego-motive that generates binding saṃskāras. Akarma is the state of the established yogi whose every movement is a divine offering — the state Yogananda described as 'acting in God.' The path of karma is indeed gahanā — unfathomable — because the same external action can be karma-binding for one person and akarma-liberating for another, depending entirely on the inner state of identification. This is why the Lord says boddhavyam — it must be known, understood — before one can walk the path correctly.","goyandka":"This verse categorizes three distinct aspects of action that the aspirant must understand. Karma here denotes the prescribed and sanctioned actions — those aligned with one's svadharma and the Vedic injunctions. Vikarma refers to actions that transgress the moral and scriptural boundaries — actions that accumulate pāpa (demerit) and bind the soul. Akarma is the most subtle: it is not the absence of physical movement but the state of the knower who, like the Lord of verse 14, is akartā even while acting. Gahanā karmaṇo gatiḥ — 'profound is the course of karma' — is a significant statement: it cautions against superficial understanding and calls for deep, careful inquiry under the guidance of a qualified teacher."}},{"verse":18,"sanskrit":"कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः ।\\nस बुद्धिमान्मनुष्येषु स युक्तः कृत्स्नकर्मकृत् ॥","transliteration":"karmaṇy akarma yaḥ paśyed akarmaṇi ca karma yaḥ\\nsa buddhimān manuṣyeṣu sa yuktaḥ kṛtsna-karma-kṛt","translation":"The soul who perceives the serene stillness of the witnessing Spirit within the whirlwind of outer action, and who discerns the creative divine power vibrating within apparent outer stillness — that one is truly wise among all beings.

The vision described — karmaṇy akarma, seeing non-doing within action — is the recognition of the witness-Self. While the body-mind apparatus moves, the Self remains utterly still. Conversely, akarmaṇi karma — seeing action within inaction — refers to the creative potency latent even in stillness; the unmoving Brahman from which all creation springs. The person who directly perceives this non-dual reality is called buddhimān — the one with real discernment — and yuktaḥ — the integrated one, the yogi. The phrase kṛtsna-karma-kṛt, 'performer of all action,' is paradoxical and deliberate: in doing nothing as the ego-doer, he has accomplished everything.","yogananda":"This verse describes the vision of the siddha — the perfected one — from the inside. In the highest states of samādhi, Yogananda taught, one perceives the cosmos as a vast movie of light and shadow, while the screen — the Self — remains absolutely still. In ordinary consciousness we see only the movie and think that is all there is. The yogi sees the screen. Karmaṇy akarma — in the midst of the film of action, he sees the unmoving screen. Akarmaṇi karma — in the seeming stillness of meditation, he perceives the cosmic creative pulsation of God's presence. This dual vision is not confusion; it is the simultaneous holding of relative and absolute truth. He is kṛtsna-karma-kṛt — all his karma is finished, for nothing clings to a mirror.","goyandka":"Ācārya Śaṅkara regards this verse as the highest teaching of Chapter 4. The paśyet — 'sees' — is in the optative mood, indicating the aspirational and meditative character of this vision. Karmaṇy akarma: while the body performs prescribed actions, the jñānī recognizes that the Self, which is pure Consciousness, never acts. Akarmaṇi karma: in the state of apparent bodily inaction, the cosmic creative power (māyā-śakti) continues to operate. This two-fold recognition destroys the root of karma-bondage, which is ahaṅkāra, the ego-sense 'I am the doer.' Such a one is buddhimān — truly wise — and kṛtsna-karma-kṛt — has in effect accomplished all karma, for when the doer-sense dissolves, no new karma accrues."}},{"verse":19,"sanskrit":"यस्य सर्वे समारम्भाः कामसङ्कल्पवर्जिताः ।\\nज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्माणं तमाहुः पण्डितं बुधाः ॥","transliteration":"yasya sarve samārambhāḥ kāma-saṅkalpa-varjitāḥ\\njñānāgni-dagdha-karmāṇaṃ tam āhuḥ paṇḍitaṃ budhāḥ","translation":"That luminous soul whose every undertaking arises free from personal desire and ego-agenda — whose accumulated karma has been wholly consumed in the blazing fire of divine wisdom — him do the truly wise recognize and call a paṇḍita, the genuinely enlightened one whose inner sun has risen above all clouds of self-seeking.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch04/verse_04_19.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"समारम्भाः","transliteration":"samārambhāḥ","root":"sam + ā + √rambh (to undertake, to begin)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"undertakings / enterprises / beginnings of action"},{"word":"कामसङ्कल्पवर्जिताः","transliteration":"kāma-saṅkalpa-varjitāḥ","root":"kāma (desire) + saṅkalpa (intention/will) + √vṛj (to abandon)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective (bahuvrīhi), masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"devoid of desire and selfish intention / free from craving and resolve toward personal goals"},{"word":"ज्ञानाग्नि","transliteration":"jñānāgni","root":"jñāna (knowledge) + agni (fire)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun (tatpuruṣa), masculine","meaning":"the fire of knowledge / the flame of wisdom"},{"word":"दग्धकर्माणम्","transliteration":"dagdha-karmāṇam","root":"√dah (to burn) + karma — past passive participle compound","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"one whose karmas have been burned / he whose actions are incinerated"},{"word":"पण्डितम्","transliteration":"paṇḍitam","root":"paṇḍā (wisdom, learning) + ita (possessing)","grammatical_form":"Noun/adjective, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"the paṇḍita / the truly learned one / the wise man"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"A paṇḍita is not just a scholar.

The fire of jñāna does not burn the person; it burns the karmas. It liberates. The wise — budhāḥ — recognize such a person. They call him paṇḍita. That recognition is not a social honor. It is a spiritual fact.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse offers two defining marks of the paṇḍita, the truly wise person. First: kāma-saṅkalpa-varjitāḥ samārambhāḥ — every undertaking is free from desire and resolution (saṅkalpa) toward personal ends. Saṅkalpa here is subtle — it is the background intention, the mental image of a desired result, that sets action in motion. The paṇḍita acts without this inner agenda. Second: jñānāgni-dagdha-karmāṇam — his accumulated karmas, the vāsanā-seeds of past actions, have been incinerated by the fire of Brahma-jñāna. The Self-knowledge burns not just current karma but the entire storehouse of prārabdha waiting to fructify. This is the Advaita understanding: jñāna is not merely insight but a conflagration that destroys the very root of bondage.","yogananda":"Yogananda loved the image of jñānāgni — the fire of wisdom — because it is so vivid and so precise. Ordinary fire burns matter into ash. The fire of spiritual wisdom burns the ego-self into dissolution. What remains is not nothing — it is the pure, luminous ātman. The paṇḍita, in Yogananda's teaching, is one who has meditated so deeply and served so completely that the self-serving layer of the mind has been consumed. Every action that arises from such a one is therefore spontaneously kāma-saṅkalpa-varjita — free of desire and ego-agenda — not because he suppresses desire but because there is no longer a separate self to desire. Budhāḥ — the truly wise — recognize this person by the quality of their very presence.","goyandka":"The two conditions for being called a true paṇḍita are stated with precision. Kāma-saṅkalpa-varjitāḥ samārambhāḥ: the fourfold meaning is that all his enterprises — whether speech, thought, bodily action, or mental resolve — are utterly free from kāma (selfish desire) and saṅkalpa (personal purposive will). This is niṣkāma karma in its fullest expression. Jñānāgni-dagdha-karmāṇam: the accumulated prārabdha, āgāmī, and saṃcita karmas — the three types recognized in the tradition — have been rendered powerless by the heat of discrimination and Self-knowledge. The fire of jñāna does not burn physically but burns the chains of identification. Budhāḥ — those who themselves possess wisdom — are the ones qualified to recognize and name such a soul as paṇḍita."}},{"verse":20,"sanskrit":"त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रयः ।\\nकर्मण्यभिप्रवृत्तोऽपि नैव किञ्चित्करोति सः ॥","transliteration":"tyaktvā karma-phalāsaṅgaṃ nitya-tṛpto nirāśrayaḥ\\nkarmaṇy abhipravṛtto 'pi naiva kiñcit karoti saḥ","translation":"Having wholly released all clinging to the fruits of action, ever resting in the deep inner fullness of the Soul that needs nothing from the world — this liberated one, though outwardly immersed in the thick of life's demands, remains inwardly untouched.

Three brushstrokes. Tyaktvā karma-phalāsaṅgam — he has let go of clinging to results. Not that he doesn't act; he acts fully, abhipravṛttaḥ — completely engaged. But the fruit? He holds it like water in an open palm. Nitya-tṛptaḥ — ever satisfied. Not after getting what he wanted; satisfied from within, from the source. Nirāśrayaḥ — needing nothing, depending on nothing for his wholeness. And yet — naiva kiñcit karoti saḥ — he does nothing whatsoever. This is the mystery and the gift. When there is no ego-doer, action flows like river water — it moves, it nourishes, it goes where it goes, and it does not cling to the banks.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the Gita's portrait of jīvanmukti — liberation while alive. Three qualities define this state. Karma-phalāsaṅga-tyāga: the abandonment of attachment to results, which severs the link between action and bondage at its root — for it is āsaṅga, clinging, that converts action into karma. Nitya-tṛpta: this is the fullness of Brahman — ānanda without object, satisfaction without cause, pūrṇatva. Nirāśraya: no external support needed because the support is the Self itself, which is self-luminous and self-sufficient. And the paradoxical conclusion: karmaṇy abhipravṛttaḥ api naiva kiñcit karoti — 'though fully engaged, he does nothing.' The body acts; the Self does not act. The rope burns; only the serpent-illusion is destroyed.","yogananda":"Yogananda described this verse as the practical definition of the yogi-in-the-world. Nitya-tṛpta — always satisfied — is the inner signature of God-union. One who has tasted the infinite bliss of samādhi is not perpetually chasing the fleeting satisfactions of sense-objects. The outer life continues — abhipravṛttaḥ api, even while fully active — but the center of gravity has permanently shifted to the Self. Nirāśraya — without external support — does not mean social isolation; it means one's peace is not dependent on circumstances. And naiva kiñcit karoti saḥ — the deepest affirmation: when the ego has dissolved, who is there to do anything? The body moves by divine will; the Self simply shines. This is the divine life.","goyandka":"This verse presents three characteristics of the karma-yogi who has arrived at the state of jñāna. Tyaktvā karma-phalāsaṅgam — having relinquished attachment to results — corresponds to the Gita's central injunction in 2.47: mā phaleṣu kadācana. Nitya-tṛptaḥ — eternally content — is a quality of one whose satisfaction comes from the ātman itself, not from external acquisition. Nirāśrayaḥ — having no dependence — indicates freedom from the three supports that ordinarily bind: material resources, social approval, and sensory pleasure. The verse culminates in the paradox of karma-yoga: karmaṇy abhipravṛttaḥ api naiva kiñcit karoti saḥ. Though visibly engaged in action, in reality he does nothing — for he has dissolved the doer. This is the fulfillment of the teaching of chapters 3 and 4 together."}},{"verse":21,"sanskrit":"निराशीर्यतचित्तात्मा त्यक्तसर्वपरिग्रहः ।\\nशारीरं केवलं कर्म कुर्वन्नाप्नोति किल्बिषम् ॥","transliteration":"nirāśīr yata-cittātmā tyakta-sarva-parigrahaḥ\\nśārīraṃ kevalaṃ karma kurvan nāpnoti kilbiṣam","translation":"Free from the restless hunger of personal expectation, with the mind and Spirit held in the calm sovereignty of Self-mastery, having relinquished the inner sense of possession over all things — such a luminous soul performs only what the body truly requires.

Krishna is describing the inner state of a true karmayogi — someone who has let go of all grasping and anxiety about outcomes. Nirāśīḥ does not mean hopeless in the sad sense; it means free from the desperate clinging to results that poisons so much of our action. When we act only to maintain the body — to breathe, to serve, to fulfill our duty — without accumulating anything for ourselves, there is a tremendous lightness. I have seen this in the truly blessed — they move through the world like a breeze, touching everything but holding nothing. No sin can stick to such a one, because sin is the residue of selfish desire. Let us pray to be even a little like this.","sarvapriyananda":"Verse 21 gives us the portrait of the jīvanmukta — one liberated while still living. Three qualifications are named: nirāśīḥ (free from all hope or expectation of reward), yata-cittātmā (mind and intellect subdued through discriminative practice), and tyakta-sarva-parigrahaḥ (all possessiveness relinquished). For Advaita Vedanta, possessiveness is rooted in the false identification of the Self with body-mind. When ahaṃkāra — the ego-sense — weakens, the grip on 'mine' dissolves. Action then occurs only at the physical level, śārīraṃ kevalaṃ, as a spontaneous expression of existence rather than a strategy for gain. Such action generates no karma — no saṃskāric residue — because there is no 'someone' to accumulate it.","yogananda":"The master Yogi who has dissolved self-will performs only those actions necessary to sustain the instrument of the body for continued divine service. 'Without hope' means the consciousness rests in the soul's inherent bliss, not in future expectation. 'Self-controlled' describes the yogi who has interiorized the life-force through pranayama and meditation, so that the restless mind no longer scatters outward. 'Having abandoned all possessions' is the inner non-attachment; the yogi may live simply or even abundantly, but nothing owns him. In this state of inner freedom, action flows from the Infinite through the body without creating binding impressions — just as a clean mirror reflects light without absorbing or being changed by it.","goyandka":"Śrī Bhagavān here delineates the marks of one who acts without incurring karma. Nirāśīḥ: one who has given up longing for the fruits of action in this world or the next. Yata-cittātmā: one whose mind and intellect are governed by discrimination and dispassion. Tyakta-sarva-parigrahaḥ: one who has renounced even the internal sense of ownership, 'this is mine.' Such a person performs only what is absolutely necessary for bodily sustenance — nothing for pleasure, accumulation, or prestige. The Gītā is emphatic: karma binds not the act itself but the doer's self-identification with the act and its fruits. When that identification is absent, action leaves no karmic trace."}},{"verse":22,"sanskrit":"यदृच्छालाभसन्तुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सरः ।\\nसमः सिद्धावसिद्धौ च कृत्वापि न निबध्यते ॥","transliteration":"yadṛcchā-lābha-santuṣṭo dvandvātīto vimatsaraḥ\\namaḥ siddhāv asiddhau ca kṛtvāpi na nibadhyate","translation":"Receiving with open and grateful hands whatever God's grace brings unsought, soaring beyond the restless seesaw of pleasure and pain, free from the contracted suffering of envy, dwelling in unshakable equanimity whether success or failure visit the outer life — such a self-realized soul acts fully and freely in the world, yet is never, in any moment, bound.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch04/verse_04_22.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यदृच्छालाभसन्तुष्टः","transliteration":"yadṛcchā-lābha-santuṣṭaḥ","root":"yadṛcchā (chance, spontaneous) + lābha (gain) + √tuṣ (to be satisfied)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative, singular (compound)","meaning":"satisfied with whatever comes unsought / content with chance gains"},{"word":"द्वन्द्वातीतः","transliteration":"dvandvātītaḥ","root":"dvandva (pair of opposites) + √i (to go) + atīta (transcended)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative, singular (compound)","meaning":"one who has transcended the pairs of opposites (pleasure-pain, heat-cold, gain-loss)"},{"word":"विमत्सरः","transliteration":"vimatsaraḥ","root":"vi (without) + matsara (envy, jealousy)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"free from envy / without jealousy"},{"word":"निबध्यते","transliteration":"nibadhyate","root":"ni + √bandh (to bind)","grammatical_form":"Verb, present passive, 3rd person singular","meaning":"is bound / is fettered / is entangled"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"What a beautiful portrait of a free soul this verse paints!

And dvandvātīta — beyond the seesaw of pleasure and pain, heat and cold, praise and blame. The wise one watches these pairs come and go like clouds across the sky, unshaken. Free from envy — how much suffering envy causes! When you see another's joy as your loss, you have forgotten your own divine wholeness. Such a one acts fully yet remains utterly free.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse describes four hallmarks of the liberated actor. First, yadṛcchā-lābha-santuṣṭaḥ: contentment with unsought gains — meaning the wise person does not scheme or manipulate circumstances, but accepts gracefully what Providence offers. Second, dvandvātītaḥ: transcendence of dvandvas, the binary fluctuations of phenomenal experience — the Vedantic teaching is that dvandvas belong to the body-mind, not to the ātman. Third, vimatsaraḥ: free from matsara, the painful contraction of envy. Fourth, samaḥ: equanimity in siddhi (success) and asiddhi (failure). These four together constitute the state of sthita-prajña, the one of steady wisdom. Such a person acts completely — kṛtvāpi — yet is not bound, because there is no inner claimant.","yogananda":"This verse describes the soul established in cosmic consciousness, who participates in the dance of duality without being caught by it. 'Whatever comes by chance' reflects the understanding that all events flow from the one Cosmic Will — the master does not prefer one outcome over another, for he sees the Beloved's hand in all. 'Beyond the pairs of opposites' is the state achieved through deep meditation when the devotee rises above the oscillations of sensory experience to rest in the ever-calm Self. 'Free from envy' follows naturally — one who lives in the ocean of infinite bliss cannot envy the few drops another person seems to possess. In success and failure alike he reads the same divine handwriting, and so is never bound.","goyandka":"Having described the marks of the karmayogi in the previous verse, the Lord here adds four more: contentment with unsought gain (which precludes prohibited or anxious striving), transcendence of pleasure and pain (which frees action from emotional compulsion), absence of envy (which ensures no agitation at another's prosperity), and equanimity in success and failure (which prevents elation and despair from disturbing the mind). It must be noted that kṛtvāpi — 'even while acting' — is the key phrase. The Lord is not prescribing inaction but rather action performed with this inner constellation.

Not reduced, not managed, but entirely melted away. This is the miracle Krishna is describing. When a person has truly let go of clinging — gata-saṅga, the attachment is gone, not suppressed — when they are mukta, truly free in their heart, when their mind rests like still water in the clarity of divine knowledge — then all their action becomes yajña, an offering to the Lord. And what happens to offering placed in the sacred fire? It is transformed, purified, released. No karma accumulates for such a one. This is why the Gītā is so revolutionary: it does not demand you stop acting. It asks you to change the inner orientation — from grasping to offering. Then all of life becomes worship.","sarvapriyananda":"Verse 23 is the logical culmination of the preceding two verses. The three conditions for complete dissolution of karma are: gata-saṅga (freedom from saṅga — the sticky quality of ego-attachment to objects, persons, and outcomes), mukta (liberation — here referring to the ongoing inner state of freedom from false identification with body-mind), and jñānāvasthita-cetas (a mind continuously abiding in the knowledge 'I am Brahman, not the doer'). The fourth element is the mode of action: yajñāya ācarataḥ — acting purely as sacrifice, as offering. When all four conditions obtain simultaneously, samagraṃ karma pravilīyate — karma dissolves completely. There is no partial dissolution; it is total, because the karmic mechanism itself — the ego-identification — has been dismantled.","yogananda":"When the devotee has dissolved the separating membrane of ego-attachment through sustained meditation, when the liberating light of Self-knowledge illumines every corner of the mind, then all activity becomes an expression of the Infinite acting through a transparent instrument. Yajñāya ācarataḥ: acting as sacrifice — this is the yogi who has offered his very will into the divine fire and now moves only as God wills. In that state the notion of personal karma becomes meaningless: there is no personal entity to accumulate impressions. Sri Ramakrishna demonstrated this perfectly — he acted constantly, loved intensely, yet remained ever established in samādhi. His actions left no personal karmic trace because the 'person' had been wholly offered at the altar of the Divine Mother.","goyandka":"The Gītāchārya here states the principle with mathematical precision: three attributes of the actor plus one attribute of the act equal complete karmic dissolution. Gata-saṅga: when saṅga (attachment) itself has departed, not merely been suppressed. Mukta: when the individual considers himself free from bondage, not identifying as a bound jīva. Jñānāvasthita-cetas: when the intellect is stabilized in the knowledge of the real (ātma-jñāna), not oscillating between knowledge and ignorance. And the act itself must be yajñāya: performed for the sake of sacrifice alone, not for any personal purpose. The verb pravilīyate (dissolves completely) is significant — it indicates that not even subtle karmic residue (sūkṣma-karma) remains."}},{"verse":24,"sanskrit":"ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविर्ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम् ।\\nब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना ॥","transliteration":"brahmārpaṇaṃ brahma havir brahmāgnau brahmaṇā hutam\\nbrahmaiva tena gantavyaṃ brahma-karma-samādhinā","translation":"The instrument of offering is God; the oblation poured is God; the sacred fire that receives it is God; the one who pours is God — and God alone is the destination reached.

In brahma-karma-samādhi — absorption of Brahman in action — all five collapse into one: Brahman. Śaṃkarācārya comments that this verse describes the vision of the jñānī performing action: he sees only Brahman everywhere — as the instrument (arpaṇam), the material (haviḥ), the recipient (agni), the doer (brahmaṇā), and the result (brahmaiva gantavyam). This is not imagination; it is the direct perception of non-dual reality through which all karma is transformed into liberation itself.","yogananda":"In this supreme verse, the Divine Beloved reveals the ultimate mystery of sacrifice to His devotee Arjuna. The outer fire sacrifice of the priests becomes an inner cosmic vision: every element of the universe — the act, the instrument, the substance, the fire, the offerer — is recognized as none other than the one Infinite Consciousness, the Eternal Brahman. The great Paramahansa taught that in the highest state of samādhi the devotee dissolves into God so completely that even the distinction between devotee and God disappears. Brahma-karma-samādhi is precisely this: complete absorption of the sense of personal agency into the Cosmic Actor. The yogi in kriyā or in the deepest meditation practices this vision: every prāṇa offered into apāna, every breath, every sensation — all is the play of the Infinite in the Infinite.","goyandka":"This majestic verse requires careful analysis. Arpaṇam: the sruk (large ladle) used in sacrifice — here signifying the entire instrument or means of action — is Brahman. Haviḥ: the ghee or material offered — signifying the object of action — is Brahman. Brahmāgnau: the fire into which it is poured — signifying the field of action — is Brahman. Brahmaṇā hutam: the pouring is done by Brahman — the actor is Brahman. And therefore brahmaiva gantavyam: the result too is Brahman — the attainment is Brahman. This is the vision of the brahmavid (knower of Brahman). Every element of karmic structure — kāraka, karma, and kriyā — is Brahman.

Some sincere seekers perform traditional rituals, offering with great devotion to Indra, to Agni, to Varuna — the great cosmic powers. This is beautiful, and it yields purification and merit. Others, with a deeper vision — perhaps those who have encountered a realized teacher — see the entire cosmos as Brahman and offer the very act of sacrifice into that infinite fire. The fire of Brahman consumes everything, including the ego of the one who sacrifices. Both are paths of the heart. The Lord honors both. What matters is the sincerity of offering, not the sophistication of the theology behind it.","sarvapriyananda":"Beginning with verse 25, Śrī Kṛṣṇa catalogs a magnificent array of yajña-forms, expanding the concept of sacrifice from Vedic ritual to encompass every possible mode of spiritual practice. The first two categories: daiva-yajña (worship of gods) and brahma-yajña (offering sacrifice into Brahman itself). The distinction is important from the Advaita standpoint. Daiva-yajña operates within the framework of duality — there are gods who are separate recipients of worship. Brahma-yajña dissolves this framework — the sacrifice, the fire, and the act of offering are all recognized as Brahman, as verse 24 established. Both are valid stages of the spiritual ascent. The Gītā never dismisses ritual; it sublates it into a higher understanding.","yogananda":"The Divine Teacher here begins His glorious enumeration of the many forms of sacrifice — all of them paths to liberation, each suited to a different temperament and level of development. The devotional seeker who worships the cosmic gods — Indra (the intelligence-principle), Agni (the energy-principle) — is purifying his consciousness through the recognition of divine power in nature. The advancing yogi who pours sacrifice itself into the fire of Brahman has understood that the worshipper, the worshipped, and the act of worship are one undivided Consciousness. This second form corresponds to the highest stages of meditation, where the meditator, the meditation, and the object of meditation merge into samādhi — the fire of Brahman consuming all distinctions.","goyandka":"The Lord now begins a systematic classification of yajñas to show that the term encompasses far more than external fire sacrifice. Two types are presented here. First: daiva-yajña — sacrifice directed to the devatās, performed in accordance with scriptural injunction, with proper materials, mantras, and procedures. This fulfils dharmic obligations and gradually purifies the mind. Second: brahma-yajña — the higher sacrifice in which the ritualist recognizes Brahman as the fire, the oblation, and the act itself, as detailed in verse 24. The difference between these two is not one of external form but of internal understanding: the first works with duality, the second dissolves it. Both are honored by the Lord as valid modes of yoga."}},{"verse":26,"sanskrit":"श्रोत्रादीनीन्द्रियाण्यन्ये संयमाग्निषु जुह्वति ।\\nशब्दादीन्विषयानन्य इन्द्रियाग्निषु जुह्वति ॥","transliteration":"śrotrādīnīndriyāṇy anye saṃyamāgniṣu juhvati\\nśabdādīn viṣayān anya indriyāgniṣu juhvati","translation":"Other sincere seekers offer the sense organs themselves — hearing, touch, sight, taste, and smell — as sacred fuel into the inner fire of self-restraint, withdrawing the outgoing forces of perception inward toward the Spirit.

The first group offers the senses themselves into the fire of saṃyama — restraint. This is the path of one who practices withdrawal of the senses, like the tortoise drawing in its limbs, gradually reducing the power of the outgoing tendency. The second group is subtler — they allow the senses to engage with their objects (sound, touch, form, taste, smell) but offer those very contacts as oblations into the fire of the senses, meaning they consume the experience consciously without letting it create craving or aversion. Both are valid yajñas. The Lord is showing us that even how we use our senses can become a sacred practice. Truly, all of life can be made into worship.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents two contrasting but equally valid approaches to sense-management as spiritual practice. The first — saṃyama-yajña: the practitioner sacrifices the sense organs themselves (śrotrādi) into the fires of restraint (saṃyama). This corresponds to the pratyāhāra of Patañjali's Yoga — the systematic withdrawal of sensory awareness from external objects. The senses are not used; they are offered up. The second — indriya-yajña: the practitioner allows the senses to contact their objects (śabdādi viṣayāḥ) but offers those very contacts into the sense-fires — meaning sensory experience is witnessed and released without creating saṃskāras. The first path restrains the instruments; the second path transforms the relationship with experience itself. Both qualify as yajña.","yogananda":"The great Master of Yoga here describes two inner sacrificial paths. The first group — those who pour the senses into the fires of restraint — are the practitioners of pratyāhāra and dhāraṇā: by withdrawing the perceptive powers from their outward objects and directing them inward toward the divine Light, the senses are, as it were, burned in the sacred fire of self-discipline, purified of their restlessness. The second group offers the sense-objects themselves: they engage with the world of form and sound but with such inner detachment and mindfulness that each sensory contact is an offering — felt, witnessed, released — creating no binding impression. The spiritual aspirant may practice both: first restraining the senses in meditation, then engaging the world with the mindfulness of a yogi.","goyandka":"The Bhagavān describes here two forms of indriya-yajña. In the first, the jñānendriya-s — the five cognitive senses beginning with hearing (śrotra) — are themselves the oblation offered into the fires of saṃyama (disciplined restraint). This means the senses are held back from their objects through vairāgya and viveka; their outgoing tendency is sacrificed. In the second, the viṣaya-s — the objects of the senses: sound (śabda), touch (sparśa), form (rūpa), taste (rasa), smell (gandha) — are the oblation offered into the fires of the sense organs. This corresponds to the practice of careful, conscious engagement: one meets sense-objects but without attachment, as if offering them to the sense-fires which consume them without residue."}},{"verse":27,"sanskrit":"सर्वाणीन्द्रियकर्माणि प्राणकर्माणि चापरे ।\\nआत्मसंयमयोगाग्नौ जुह्वति ज्ञानदीपिते ॥","transliteration":"sarvāṇīndriya-karmāṇi prāṇa-karmāṇi cāpare\\nātma-saṃyama-yogāgnau juhvati jñāna-dīpite","translation":"Yet others — the advanced yogis walking the royal inner path — offer the entire range of sense activities and all the sacred functions of the life-force into the brilliant fire of the yoga of complete Self-mastery, a fire kindled and kept alive by the pure light of divine wisdom burning within the purified soul.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch04/verse_04_27.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"इन्द्रियकर्माणि","transliteration":"indriya-karmāṇi","root":"indriya (sense organ) + karman (function, action)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, accusative, plural (compound)","meaning":"all the functions and activities of the sense organs"},{"word":"प्राणकर्माणि","transliteration":"prāṇa-karmāṇi","root":"prāṇa (vital breath, life-force) + karman (function, action)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, accusative, plural (compound)","meaning":"all the functions of the vital breath / all activities of the prāṇic force"},{"word":"आत्मसंयमयोगाग्नौ","transliteration":"ātma-saṃyama-yogāgnau","root":"ātman + sam + √yam + yoga + agni","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, locative, singular (compound)","meaning":"into the fire of the yoga of self-restraint / in the sacred fire of the discipline of self-control"},{"word":"ज्ञानदीपिते","transliteration":"jñāna-dīpite","root":"jñāna (knowledge) + √dīp (to kindle, to illuminate)","grammatical_form":"Past passive participle, masculine/neuter, locative, singular","meaning":"kindled by knowledge / illumined and ignited by wisdom"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This is a profound verse, dear one, and somewhat subtle. The previous verse described those who restrain the senses or offer sense-objects. Here the Lord describes a complete offering: all functions of the senses — every act of seeing, hearing, tasting, touching, smelling — and all functions of the vital prāṇa — breathing, digesting, moving — all of these are poured into the fire of ātma-saṃyama-yoga, the practice of complete inner self-discipline. And this fire, this yoga, is kindled by jñāna — by true knowledge of the Self. This is the integrated spiritual life where no corner of experience is left outside the sacred fire. Every breath, every sensation, every thought is offered up. Such a practice must be ignited by knowledge, not mere will-power, for only the light of wisdom can sustain this complete an inner sacrifice.","sarvapriyananda":"Verse 27 describes what might be called integral yoga-yajña. The offerings here are comprehensive: sarvāṇi indriya-karmāṇi — all the activities of the cognitive and conative senses (not just hearing, but all perceptual and motor functions), and prāṇa-karmāṇi — all the activities of the five prāṇas (prāṇa, apāna, samāna, udāna, vyāna) governing biological functions. All of these are offered into ātma-saṃyama-yoga-agni — the fire of the yoga of total self-restraint. The crucial qualifier is jñāna-dīpite: this fire is kindled by Self-knowledge. Without jñāna, self-restraint is mere austerity and can generate pride or rigidity. When lit by the understanding 'I am not the doer, not the senser, not the breather,' restraint becomes transparent liberation.","yogananda":"This verse describes the advanced kriyā yogi who has placed even the prāṇic functions under the altar of inner sacrifice. Prāṇa-karmāṇi — the activities of the life-force: the rising and falling of breath, the pulse of energy through the spine, the humming of prāṇa in the senses — all of this is offered into the fire of ātma-saṃyama-yoga, the yoga of complete self-mastery. This fire is jñāna-dīpita — kindled by the wisdom that the prāṇa is not 'mine' but is the universal Life appearing in this form. The true kriyābān yogi interiorizes both breath and sensation, offering them at the altar of the ātman. In deep kriyā practice, breathing becomes minimal and the prāṇic energy rises inward and upward — this is the practical demonstration of this verse.","goyandka":"This verse extends the scope of yoga-yajña to encompass the totality of human function. Indriya-karmāṇi includes both jñānendriya-karma (the activity of the five sense organs) and karmendriya-karma (the activity of the five organs of action — hands, feet, speech, reproductive organ, organs of elimination). Prāṇa-karmāṇi refers to the five vital functions (prāṇa: respiration; apāna: excretion; samāna: digestion; udāna: upward movement; vyāna: circulation). All of these — the complete range of psychophysical functioning — are surrendered into the fire of ātma-saṃyama-yoga: complete inner self-discipline. The all-important condition is jñāna-dīpite: this fire must be kindled by wisdom. Self-discipline rooted in ignorance leads to rigidity; rooted in Self-knowledge, it leads to liberation."}},{"verse":28,"sanskrit":"द्रव्ययज्ञास्तपोयज्ञा योगयज्ञास्तथापरे ।\\nस्वाध्यायज्ञानयज्ञाश्च यतयः संशितव्रताः ॥","transliteration":"dravya-yajñās tapo-yajñā yoga-yajñās tathāpare\\nsvādhyāya-jñāna-yajñāś ca yatayaḥ saṃśita-vratāḥ","translation":"Still other seekers of God offer their material wealth in sacred charity, others offer austerity and disciplined renunciation of physical ease, others offer the meditative disciplines of yoga, and others offer the sacred study of scripture and the living inquiry into divine wisdom — all of them strivers of sharpened and unwavering spiritual vow, each honoring God through the unique gift of their path.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch04/verse_04_28.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"द्रव्ययज्ञाः","transliteration":"dravya-yajñāḥ","root":"dravya (material wealth, substance) + yajña (sacrifice)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, plural (compound)","meaning":"those for whom sacrifice is material offering / practitioners of material sacrifice (dana)"},{"word":"तपोयज्ञाः","transliteration":"tapo-yajñāḥ","root":"tapas (austerity, heat, discipline) + yajña (sacrifice)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, plural (compound)","meaning":"those for whom sacrifice is austerity / practitioners of tapas as yajña"},{"word":"स्वाध्यायज्ञानयज्ञाः","transliteration":"svādhyāya-jñāna-yajñāḥ","root":"sva (own) + adhyāya (study) + jñāna (knowledge) + yajña","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, plural (compound)","meaning":"those whose sacrifice is Vedic self-study and knowledge / practitioners of jñāna-yajña"},{"word":"संशितव्रताः","transliteration":"saṃśita-vratāḥ","root":"sam + √śā (to sharpen, to intensify) + vrata (vow, religious observance)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative, plural (compound)","meaning":"of sharpened / intensified vows / with firmly strengthened resolves"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"What joy it gives me to see how the Lord encompasses every sincere path in His vision of yajña!

The practitioners of all these are characterized as yatayaḥ (strivers) and saṃśita-vratāḥ (those of sharpened vows). The Gītā's inclusivity here is remarkable — it validates every form of sincere spiritual effort as a valid path to liberation.","yogananda":"The Blessed Lord enumerates here the four great paths of sacrifice available to sincere seekers of truth. Dravya-yajña is practiced by the devotee who consecrates his material wealth to God through charitable giving — recognizing all possessions as held in trust from the Divine. Tapo-yajña is the path of those who purify body, speech, and mind through systematic austerity — fasting, silence, endurance. Yoga-yajña is the royal path of meditation, pranayama, and the eight limbs of yoga by which the practitioner systematically yokes the individual soul to the Universal. Svādhyāya-jñāna-yajña is the sacrifice of the mind's false certainties into the fire of scriptural study and Self-inquiry. All these paths are honored — all purify, all liberate, when practiced by saṃśita-vratāḥ: those whose spiritual vow has been made irrevocably.","goyandka":"The Bhagavān enumerates four additional categories of yajña-practitioners. Dravya-yajñāḥ: those who perform sacrifice through material means — offerings of food, money, gold, and goods to the deserving (brāhmaṇas, the poor, temples). This is the path of dāna (generosity) elevated to the level of sacred sacrifice. Tapo-yajñāḥ: those for whom tapas itself is the yajña — physical austerity (fasting, exposure to elements), verbal austerity (silence, truthful speech), and mental austerity (equanimity, restraint of thought). Yoga-yajñāḥ: practitioners of the eightfold yoga who offer the scattered functions of body and mind into the discipline of yoga. Svādhyāya-jñāna-yajñāḥ: those who sacrifice through Vedic recitation (svādhyāya) and through jñāna — the direct inquiry into the nature of the Self.

In this inner fire sacrifice, the inhaled prāṇa is offered into the apāna (the exhalation energy), and the apāna is offered into the prāṇa — they merge, they balance, they neutralize each other. And then in kumbhaka — the suspension of breath — both movements are stilled, offered up completely. The prāṇāyāmi knows that where breath ceases, thought ceases, and where thought ceases, the mind becomes quiet enough to hear the silent voice of the ātman. This is a most powerful sādhana. Even in daily life, a few minutes of conscious prāṇāyāma can transform our inner state. The yogi who has mastered this lives in a continuous state of inner worship.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse makes explicit that prāṇāyāma — the fourth of Patañjali's eight limbs — is a form of yajña as honored by the Gītā as any external fire sacrifice. The technical description is precise: apāne juhvati prāṇam — they pour prāṇa (the ascending inhalation-force) as oblation into apāna (the descending exhalation-force); and prāṇe 'pānam — they pour apāna back into prāṇa. This describes the reciprocal regulation of inhalation (pūraka) and exhalation (recaka). Then prāṇāpāna-gatī ruddhvā — restraining both movements — describes kumbhaka (breath retention), where both currents are offered up and held in suspension. In this state, the interiorized prāṇa withdraws the mind from the senses, enabling pratyāhāra and dhāraṇā to arise naturally.","yogananda":"My Guru, Sri Yukteswar, and his Guru, Lahiri Mahasaya, taught that this verse is none other than the Gītā's direct reference to Kriyā Yoga. The sacred science of Kriyā involves precisely this: the conscious offering of prāṇa into apāna and apāna into prāṇa through systematic rotation of the life-current in the spine — the path from mūlādhāra to sahasrāra and back. By this reciprocal offering, the two currents neutralize each other, breath is naturally suspended in kevala-kumbhaka, and the life-force is withdrawn from the senses and offered at the altar of the brain's divine center.

This seemingly simple practice — mindful, moderate eating — is here elevated to the level of sacred sacrifice. And then comes the great declaration: sarve 'py ete yajña-vidaḥ — all of these, every single one of these practitioners, from the most sophisticated jñānin to the one who simply moderates his food — they are all yajña-vids, true knowers of sacrifice.

The description prāṇān prāṇeṣu juhvati — offering the prāṇas into the prāṇas — may signify that by controlling food intake, the vital airs (which are fed by digested food) are themselves brought under regulation, each prāṇa functioning at its optimum without excess. The verse then delivers its grand conclusion: sarve 'py ete yajña-vidaḥ — all of these practitioners, across all these forms of yajña, are yajña-vids: true knowers of the deepest meaning of sacrifice. And by that knowledge, yajña-kṣapita-kalmaṣāḥ: their karmic impurities are entirely consumed.","yogananda":"The Bhagavān completes His enumeration with the practitioners of āhāra-niyama — regulation of food. Mitāhāra is integral to prāṇāyāma practice: overeating creates heaviness in the prāṇic field, disturbs the nāḍīs, and makes interiorization of consciousness difficult. The yogi who eats sparingly and mindfully is offering the very process of metabolism — the prāṇas engaged in digestion — into the sacred fire of purified prāṇic function. The magnificent conclusion — sarve 'py ete yajña-vidaḥ — reveals the Lord's limitless compassion and the all-embracing wisdom of the Gītā.

Prāṇān prāṇeṣu juhvati: the prāṇas in their various functions are offered, through this dietary discipline, into the fire of prāṇic regulation itself. Then comes the conclusive declaration of this entire section (verses 25–30): sarve 'py ete yajña-vidaḥ — all of these practitioners, without exception, are yajña-vids — true understanders of what sacrifice means.

This is not a physical leftover; it is the inner sweetness that fills the heart of a person who has truly given themselves to something greater. And for one who never sacrifices? Krishna says plainly — not even this world belongs to them, what to speak of the higher? The teaching here is personal and urgent: life without offering, without giving, without worship, is a life that cannot truly flower. Let us ask ourselves daily — what have we offered today?","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents the cosmological dimension of yajna. Those who consume the amṛta — the nectar-remnant of sacrifice — go to the eternal Brahman, sanātanam brahma. The word amṛta is key: it literally means 'that which is not subject to death,' a-mṛta. When action is offered as yajna, it no longer generates karma; it becomes, paradoxically, a door to the deathless. Advaita would interpret this: the one who acts with complete selflessness — whose ego is consumed in the fire of offering — is already touching Brahman. The second half is a stark warning: one who does not perform any form of yajna lacks even the basic qualification for worldly flourishing, much less liberation. The verse is an affirmation that the universe runs on sacrifice.","yogananda":"The 'nectar of sacrifice' is the bliss experienced by the devotee who has truly surrendered self-will to the Divine will in every action. This inner amṛta — the ambrosia of selfless service — is a direct taste of the soul's own immortal nature. Yogananda would teach: every meditation in which we offer the ego-self into the fire of Spirit produces this nectar. Those who regularly drink from this inner source naturally ascend to ever-higher states of consciousness, ultimately merging in the eternal Brahman. The warning about one who does not sacrifice is a spiritual law: consciousness that only grasps and never gives becomes progressively contracted, cut off even from ordinary life's blessings.","goyandka":"The Gītā Press commentary observes that yajña-śiṣṭa — the remnant of sacrifice — signifies prasāda, the grace-imbued fruit of offering. Those who receive all their enjoyment as prasāda from God, and not as a result of selfish effort, ascend to the eternal. The verse establishes the universal obligation of yajna for all embodied beings. The word kuru-sattama (best of the Kurus) is significant: Krishna addresses Arjuna thus to remind him of the elevated standard expected of one of noble lineage.

Krishna has just given us so many forms of yajna — not to confuse us, but to include everyone. Whether you are a scholar, a devotee, a yogi who controls the breath, or a simple person who offers their daily work — there is a yajna for you. All of them are spread before Brahman like different doors to the same house. And all of them have one root: karma, action. This is so important, dear one. Action done with the right spirit is never wasted. And then comes that precious promise at the end — 'knowing this, you will be liberated.' Not 'you might be,' not 'perhaps' — you will be. Let this promise settle into your heart and give you courage to act.","sarvapriyananda":"The phrase brahmaṇo mukhe has been interpreted in two ways: 'in the mouth of Brahman' — meaning within the universal sacrificial order — or 'in the face of the Veda,' since mukha also means opening or source. Either reading affirms that all these diverse yajnas exist within one sacred framework. Krishna's taxonomy of sacrifice (verses 25–30) has covered external ritual, breath-control, sense-restraint, knowledge-cultivation, and more. Now he draws all threads together: they are all karma-jān, born of action. And the conclusion is definitive — jñātvā vimokṣyase, knowing this you shall be liberated. Knowledge of the unity underlying diverse spiritual practices is itself liberating, because it dissolves the sectarian rigidity that makes practitioners feel their path alone is valid.","yogananda":"The many forms of yajna represent the infinite creativity of the Divine in leading souls back to their Source. Yogananda taught that God has designed each soul's unique path home — some through devotion, some through knowledge, some through breath-mastery, some through service. All these are 'spread before Brahman' like a feast prepared for wandering children. The phrase karma-jān — born of action — reminds us that spiritual practice must be active and intentional; liberation does not come through passive waiting but through engaged, conscious inner work. The liberating knowledge spoken of here is not book-learning but the direct inner realization that transforms the consciousness from its restless state to the stillness of the Infinite.","goyandka":"Brahmaṇo mukhe: the Gita Press tradition reads this as 'in the mouth of the Vedas' — that is, all these yajnas are sanctioned by and described within scriptural revelation. They are not human inventions but divine prescriptions for the purification of the jīva. The phrase karma-jān viddhi tān sarvān — know all of these as born of action — establishes that no form of genuine spiritual effort is outside the category of purifying karma. Even what appears to be purely mental sacrifice (jñāna-yajna) requires the action of disciplined attention. The liberating knowledge referred to in vimokṣyase is the fruit of sincere practice of any of these forms, which progressively purifies the antaḥkaraṇa until the Self stands revealed."}},{"verse":33,"sanskrit":"श्रेयान्द्रव्यमयाद्यज्ञाज्ज्ञानयज्ञः परन्तप ।\\nसर्वं कर्माखिलं पार्थ ज्ञाने परिसमाप्यते ॥","transliteration":"śreyān dravyamayād yajñāj jñāna-yajñaḥ paran-tapa\\nsarvaṃ karmākhilaṃ pārtha jñāne parisamāpyate","translation":"Greater than any outward sacrifice of material things is the inner sacrifice of wisdom, O Parantapa — for material offerings purify the outer life, but wisdom purifies the very soul.

All the external yajnas — pouring ghee into fire, offering food, performing rituals — are beautiful and good. But Krishna says clearly: jñāna-yajna, the sacrifice of knowledge, is superior. Why? Because external offerings can be misused, can feed pride, can be mechanical. But true knowledge — the kind that transforms you from within — leaves nowhere for ego to hide. And then comes this luminous statement: all action, every single act of karma, ultimately finds its completion in knowledge. This means spiritual practice is not endless — it has a destination. Every honest effort you make is moving you, even when you cannot see it, toward that light of inner knowing.","sarvapriyananda":"This is one of the most philosophically charged verses in the Gītā. Jñāna-yajna — the sacrifice of knowledge — is declared superior to dravyamaya-yajna, material sacrifice. Why? Material offerings purify and generate merit, but they remain within the field of duality. Knowledge, in the Advaitic sense, is not merely information about Brahman but direct experiential recognition of one's identity with Brahman. This alone ends the fundamental ignorance — avidyā — that is the root of all suffering. The second line is equally remarkable: sarvaṃ karmākhilaṃ jñāne parisamāpyate — all action without remainder finds its fulfillment in knowledge. This is not a demotion of karma but its ultimate consecration. Action purifies; purified consciousness becomes transparent; through that transparency, Self-knowledge dawns.","yogananda":"The inner meaning Yogananda would emphasize: dravyamaya-yajna is any practice that remains at the outer level — ritual, charity, even prayer spoken with a distracted mind. Jñāna-yajna is the practice that transforms consciousness from within, ultimately leading to direct God-contact. The deepest jñāna-yajna is meditation — the offering of ego, desire, and restless thought into the fire of concentrated awareness until the Self alone remains. The great promise — all karma culminates in knowledge — gives the sincere seeker enormous confidence. No genuine spiritual effort is ever lost. Like tributaries joining the ocean, every pure action eventually joins the stream of illuminating wisdom.","goyandka":"The Gita Press tradition is careful here: dravyamaya-yajna (material sacrifice) is not disparaged — it is prescribed by the Vedas and is indeed purifying. But it is inferior to jñāna-yajna because material sacrifice yields perishable fruits while knowledge yields the imperishable fruit of liberation. Parisamāpyate is translated by Goyandka as 'completely culminates in' — meaning all karma eventually exhausts itself in knowledge, which is the final goal. This provides a complete scheme of spiritual progress: karma begins the process of purification, leads to upāsanā (worship and meditation), which in turn matures into jñāna (knowledge of the Self). These are not competing paths but sequential stages of one integral ascent."}},{"verse":34,"sanskrit":"तद्विद्धि प्रणिपातेन परिप्रश्नेन सेवया ।\\nउपदेक्ष्यन्ति ते ज्ञानं ज्ञानिनस्तत्त्वदर्शिनः ॥","transliteration":"tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā\\nupadekṣyanti te jñānaṃ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ","translation":"O Arjuna, seek out those illumined masters who have seen the Truth face to face — and approach them with the three keys that unlock the door of divine transmission: humble prostration of the ego before the higher Self, sincere and burning questions born of true inner hunger, and devoted loving service freely rendered.

Three things are asked of us: praṇipāta — to bow, to truly humble ourselves without pretension; paripraśna — to ask genuine questions born from real inner anguish, not to show off or argue; and sevā — to serve the teacher with love and sincerity. When these three come together in a student, the teacher cannot help but give. The knowledge flows naturally, like water finding its level. The teacher described here is not just learned — they are tattva-darśī, one who has seen the truth directly. A bookish person can teach information; only one who has seen can transmit that which transforms. Approach such a one with humility, and your questions will be answered from within.","sarvapriyananda":"Verse 34 is the classical methodology of Vedantic transmission. The triad praṇipāta-paripraśna-sevā is not arbitrary but psychologically precise. Praṇipāta — prostration — dismantles the ego's armor. The ego cannot receive wisdom while asserting itself. Paripraśna — thorough inquiry — ensures that the teaching engages the student's actual doubts, not merely theoretical curiosity. Sevā — service — creates the sustained intimacy in which subtle transmission becomes possible. The teacher must be jñānī (one of deep knowledge) and tattva-darśī (one who sees reality directly, not merely conceptually). In Advaita, this is the distinction between parokṣa-jñāna (indirect knowledge) and aparokṣa-jñāna (immediate self-realization). Only the latter can transmit liberation.","yogananda":"This verse describes the immutable spiritual law of guru-disciple transmission. Yogananda taught that true wisdom cannot be found in books alone — it lives in the realized consciousness of the master, and it flows only when the disciple's receptivity is perfectly prepared. The three conditions — humble surrender, sincere questioning, and loving service — together create an interior silence, a prepared vessel. Praṇipāta removes pride; paripraśna removes lazy acceptance of secondhand belief; sevā removes self-centeredness. In that purified state, the guru's awakened consciousness touches the disciple's, and real knowing — not intellectual but transformative — occurs. Seek such a teacher with patience and persistence; when you are truly ready, the universe brings you together.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary emphasizes that this verse establishes the indispensability of a qualified guru for the highest knowledge. Self-study (svādhyāya) is good and necessary, but the knowledge that liberates — jñāna — requires personal transmission from one who embodies it. The three qualifications of the student — praṇipāta (reverence), paripraśna (discriminating inquiry), and sevā (service) — correspond to the purification of body-speech-mind respectively. The teacher's two qualifications — jñānī and tattva-darśī — distinguish between one who merely knows the scriptures and one who has realized their truth in direct experience. This verse thus defines both sides of the sacred teacher-student relationship that is the vessel for liberation."}},{"verse":35,"sanskrit":"यज्ज्ञात्वा न पुनर्मोहमेवं यास्यसि पाण्डव ।\\nयेन भूतान्यशेषाणि द्रक्ष्यस्यात्मन्यथो मयि ॥","transliteration":"yaj jñātvā na punar moham evaṃ yāsyasi pāṇḍava\\nyena bhūtāny aśeṣāṇi drakṣyasy ātmany atho mayi","translation":"When this liberating wisdom is fully realized within you, O Pandava, the veil of delusion that now darkens your heart will never fall again with such heaviness.

Krishna says: once you gain this knowledge, moha — this heaviness, this confusion, this grief — will not come back to you like this again. And then He describes what you will see instead: all beings resting in the Self, and the Self resting in Him. This is not a philosophical idea — it is a description of a state of inner vision that changes everything. When you truly see every person, every animal, every leaf as a manifestation of the one Self, how can you hate? How can you harm? How can you be lonely? Dadaji used to say that the greatest miracle is not parting oceans — it is seeing God in the person who irritates you most. This verse is pointing at that miracle.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse reveals the practical fruit of Self-knowledge: the permanent cessation of moha (fundamental delusion). The word punar — 'again' — is significant. One may have passing emotional disturbances, but the root delusion that gives rise to existential grief does not return after true jñāna. The vision described — seeing all beings in the Self, and the Self in the Divine — is the Advaitic realization of non-duality. First, ātmani: all beings are seen as modifications of the one Consciousness, the way waves are seen as water. Then, mayi: that universal Consciousness is recognized as the very Being of Krishna, the absolute Reality. This two-stage description — ātman first, then Brahman-as-Krishna — mirrors the classical progression of Advaita realization.","yogananda":"The 'delusion' spoken of is not temporary emotional confusion but the soul's fundamental amnesia — its forgetting of its divine origin. Knowledge burns away this amnesia permanently. Yogananda would teach: when the meditator enters deep samādhi, all boundaries dissolve. The practitioner first perceives all beings as expressions of the same cosmic life-force, the universal ātman. Then, plunging deeper still, that universal awareness is recognized as none other than the personal Divine — 'in Me,' says Krishna. This is the mystical vision that the great saints describe: the entire creation shining as one luminous Being. Once tasted, even briefly, it changes the way one moves through the world permanently.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes the profound sequence of this verse: first, the negative promise — na punar moham yāsyasi, you will no longer return to such delusion; then the positive vision — all beings seen first in the ātman, then in the Supreme. The word aśeṣāṇi (without exception) is emphatic: the vision of unity leaves out nothing — no being is outside it, not even those we consider adversaries or strangers. The Gita Press tradition reads this as a description of vijñāna — the realized, experiential form of jñāna that goes beyond theoretical understanding. This verse is thus a description of the highest state of spiritual attainment while living — the jīvanmukta's inner vision."}},{"verse":36,"sanskrit":"अपि चेदसि पापेभ्यः सर्वेभ्यः पापकृत्तमः ।\\nसर्वं ज्ञानप्लवेनैव वृजिनं सन्तरिष्यसि ॥","transliteration":"api ced asi pāpebhyaḥ sarvebhyaḥ pāpa-kṛttamaḥ\\nsarvaṃ jñāna-plavenaiva vṛjinaṃ santariṣyasi","translation":"O Arjuna, even if you stood as the most burdened soul among all sinners — even if the weight of lifetimes of transgression pressed upon you like a mountain — the sacred boat of divine knowledge would carry you safely across the entire ocean of sin and karma.

Krishna does not say 'even if you have sinned a little.' He says: even if you are the very worst sinner of all — pāpa-kṛttamaḥ, the most extreme case — even then, the boat of knowledge will carry you across. This is not permission to sin; it is reassurance to the one already broken by remorse that the door is not closed. Knowledge here is not mere information — it is the transforming inner light that, once lit, consumes past darkness as naturally as a lamp drives out the dark. No darkness, however long it has lasted, can resist the light that jñāna brings. Take heart.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is among the most compassionate in the entire Gītā. The logic is this: karma — including sinful karma — is rooted in avidyā, ignorance. Jñāna, true knowledge, is the direct dissolution of avidyā. When the root is removed, the fruit cannot remain. The metaphor of the plava — the raft or boat — is vivid: karma is an ocean that no amount of remedial ritual can fully drain; but knowledge is a boat that carries one across without requiring the ocean to be emptied. This is why jñāna-yajna is superior to dravyamaya-yajna: rituals can reduce karma incrementally, but knowledge transcends the entire karmic framework by removing the ignorance that makes karma binding in the first place.","yogananda":"The metaphysical logic Yogananda would offer: sin is the crystallized residue of ego-action taken in ignorance of one's divine nature. When the consciousness truly awakens to the Self — through meditation, through grace, through the guru's touch — the fundamental error is corrected. It is as though a dreamer realizes they are dreaming: the dream-actions committed in the dream do not bind the waking person. Jñāna is this awakening. No past configuration of karma can resist the light of Self-realization, because karma operates only within the dream of separated individual existence. The boat of knowledge carries the soul safely to the other shore where karma has no jurisdiction.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary reads this as a statement about the incomparable power of ātma-jñāna — knowledge of the Self. The verse uses the extreme case — the worst sinner — precisely to make clear that no karmic accumulation, however vast, is beyond the purifying power of true knowledge. This does not encourage sin; it offers hope to the genuinely repentant. The image of the plava (boat/raft) suggests that knowledge is a vehicle, not merely a concept — it actively carries one across. Goyandka emphasizes that this knowledge must be aparokṣa (direct, immediate) — not secondhand information — for it to have this liberating effect. Intellectual knowledge of theology alone cannot cross the ocean of karma."}},{"verse":37,"sanskrit":"यथैधांसि समिद्धोऽग्निर्भस्मसात्कुरुतेऽर्जुन ।\\nज्ञानाग्निः सर्वकर्माणि भस्मसात्कुरुते तथा ॥","transliteration":"yathaidhāṃsi samiddho 'gnir bhasma-sāt kurute 'rjuna\\njñānāgniḥ sarva-karmāṇi bhasma-sāt kurute tathā","translation":"O Arjuna, just as a roaring, fully kindled fire reduces even the densest pile of wood to nothing but ash — leaving no trace of what was — so does the blazing fire of divine Self-knowledge utterly incinerate all karma accumulated across countless lifetimes, leaving the soul as free and luminous as the sky after a storm has passed into silence.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch04/verse_04_37.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"समिद्धः","transliteration":"samiddhaḥ","root":"sam + √idh (to kindle, to blaze)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"well-kindled / blazing / fully ignited"},{"word":"भस्मसात्","transliteration":"bhasma-sāt","root":"bhasma (ash) + sāt (becoming, reducing to)","grammatical_form":"Indeclinable compound (avyaya)","meaning":"to ashes / into complete ash / utterly reduced"},{"word":"ज्ञानाग्निः","transliteration":"jñānāgniḥ","root":"√jñā (to know) + agni (fire)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the fire of knowledge / knowledge-as-fire"},{"word":"एधांसि","transliteration":"edhāṃsi","root":"edhas (firewood, fuel)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, accusative, plural","meaning":"pieces of firewood / fuel"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This simile is so perfect, dear one, that once you hear it, you never forget it. Watch a fire consume wood — the wood disappears completely. Not suppressed, not hidden somewhere, not waiting to return — gone, transformed into light and warmth. The fire of jñāna does exactly this to karma. It does not suppress our tendencies or push them underground where they will emerge again later. It dissolves them at the root, transforms them into light. Many people try to fight their habits and accumulated tendencies with willpower, and they exhaust themselves. But when true knowledge dawns — even a glimpse of one's real nature — the old patterns begin to loosen their hold naturally, the way ice melts in sunshine. Pray for this fire, dear one.","sarvapriyananda":"The simile here is exact, not merely illustrative. What does fire do to wood? It does not merely transform wood — it eliminates the wood's capacity to be wood ever again. The ashes cannot become wood. Similarly, when jñāna operates on karma, it destroys not just the accumulated karma but the very mechanism — ahaṃkāra (ego-sense) and avidyā (ignorance) — that produces and sustains karma. This is the Advaitic distinction between karma-kṣaya (reduction of karma through ritual or tapas) and karma-dāha (complete incineration of karma through knowledge). The word samiddha — fully blazing — is important: partial or intellectual knowledge may reduce karma, but the fully blazing fire of realization incinerate the entire store.","yogananda":"The fire Yogananda speaks of is the awakened kuṇḍalinī — the spiritual fire that, when fully aroused through deep meditation, consumes the karmic seeds stored in the spine and subtle body. But more broadly, jñānāgni is any state of heightened God-awareness in which the sense of separate, sinful individuality is completely consumed. The great saints who have entered nirvikalpa samādhi report exactly this: they emerged from deep states of cosmic consciousness free from fears and compulsions that had previously bound them. The fire of knowledge is not metaphorical — it is a real interior process, as concrete in its effects on consciousness as physical fire is on physical wood.","goyandka":"The simile of fire and wood is used here with technical precision. The word edhāṃsi refers specifically to dry firewood — ready fuel. Karma accumulated over many lifetimes is like dry wood; it is ready to produce results. The blazing fire of knowledge — jñānāgniḥ — consumes this fuel before it can sprout into experience (phala). The Gita Press tradition distinguishes between sañcita karma (stored karma awaiting fruition), prārabdha karma (already-begun karma producing the current life), and āgāmī karma (karma being accumulated now). Jñāna destroys sañcita and prevents āgāmī; prārabdha continues until the body falls, but it no longer creates new bondage for the liberated soul."}},{"verse":38,"sanskrit":"न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते ।\\nतत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति ॥","transliteration":"na hi jñānena sadṛśaṃ pavitram iha vidyate\\ntat svayaṃ yoga-saṃsiddhaḥ kālenātmani vindati","translation":"There is nothing in this entire creation — no river, no pilgrimage, no ritual, no austerity — that purifies the soul as completely and as deeply as divine Self-knowledge.

Krishna says plainly: No. Not holy rivers, not austerities, not pilgrimages, not rituals. All of these are helpful and precious in their place, but they are all purifying from the outside. Only jñāna purifies from the very core. And then comes this gentle promise: svayam — by itself, on its own, spontaneously — this knowledge finds the yogi who is ripening in their practice. You do not have to force it. You do not have to crack yourself open with effort. The word kālena means 'in time' — there is a ripening that happens through sincere, sustained practice. Like a fruit ripening on the vine, it cannot be hurried beyond its season, but if the vine is well-tended, the fruit will surely come.","sarvapriyananda":"The opening declaration — na hi jñānena sadṛśaṃ pavitram — is an absolute statement. In all of creation, nothing purifies like knowledge. The word pavitra does not only mean ritually pure; it means that which transforms the nature of what it touches. And the mechanism of discovery described is exquisite: the yoga-saṃsiddha — one perfected through the disciplines of yoga — finds this knowledge svayam (by itself), kālena (in time), ātmani (within the Self). Note: not in a temple, not in a book, not from a teacher — within oneself. This is the Advaita conviction that the Self, which is already Brahman, is self-luminous. The practices of yoga do not create the Self or import knowledge from outside — they simply remove the obstructions until the pre-existing light becomes visible.","yogananda":"Yogananda would point to the word svayam — by itself — as the key to this verse. True knowledge is not achieved by the ego's strenuous effort but by the removal of obstacles that prevent its natural self-revelation. The regular practice of meditation — Kriya Yoga in Yogananda's tradition — gradually dissolves the karmic and egoic obstructions until knowledge, like the sunrise, becomes naturally apparent. Kālena (in time) acknowledges the reality of spiritual maturation: the practitioner must be patient with the process without being passive. Each sincere meditation is removing a layer of obscuration. At some point, the accumulated effect of practice tips into revelation. The yogi finds the knowledge not 'out there' but ātmani — within the Self that was always already present.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary notes three elements in the second line: svayam (self-manifesting — it cannot be forced), yoga-saṃsiddha (ripened through the combined practice of karma and jñāna yoga), and kālena (through the natural passage of time as practice matures). The word vindati — from the root vid — means both 'to find' and 'to know.' Knowledge discovers itself within the prepared vessel. Goyandka emphasizes that this verse is a great encouragement to steady practice: the aspirant who practices yoga sincerely over time becomes qualified (adhikārī) to receive this knowledge, and when qualified, the knowledge comes of itself. The guru can point, the scriptures can describe, but the actual arising of jñāna within the ātman is a self-revealing event."}},{"verse":39,"sanskrit":"श्रद्धावाँल्लभते ज्ञानं तत्परः संयतेन्द्रियः ।\\nज्ञानं लब्ध्वा परां शान्तिमचिरेणाधिगच्छति ॥","transliteration":"śraddhāvāṃl labhate jñānaṃ tat-paraḥ saṃyatendriyaḥ\\njñānaṃ labdhvā parāṃ śāntim acireṇādhigacchati","translation":"The devotee endowed with living, luminous faith — single-heartedly absorbed in the divine quest, with the senses gathered inward under the wise sovereignty of the soul — such a one attains the liberating light of Self-knowledge.

The first is śraddhā, which is not blind belief but a living trust, a heart-leaning toward the truth. The second is tat-para — being entirely intent on That, not distracted by a thousand other things. The third is saṃyatendriya — the one who has brought the senses under the guidance of the inner wisdom, so they do not constantly drag the mind outward. These three create the conditions in which knowledge flows in naturally, the way water flows into a vessel that is properly positioned and open. And once knowledge comes, peace — parā śānti, the highest peace — comes acireṇa, swiftly. Not after a long wait, not in some distant future life. Swiftly. Be encouraged.","sarvapriyananda":"The three qualifications listed here are a progression. Śraddhā — faith or earnest aspiration — is the beginning: the intellect turns toward the possibility of truth and leans into it. Tat-para — devotion to that alone — is the deepening: the whole life begins to orient around the inquiry. Saṃyatendriya — sense restraint — is the purification: the energy that was dispersed outward through the senses is now recollected inward. Together, these three mature the antaḥkaraṇa — the inner organ — to the point of readiness. Then jñāna is attained; not as information but as direct cognition. And the result — parāṃ śāntim — supreme peace — is not a temporary state but the natural condition of the Self recognized as such. Acireṇa (quickly) confirms that genuine ripening does not require endless lifetimes.","yogananda":"Yogananda taught that śraddhā is not mere credulity; it is the soul's innate recognition that truth exists and can be found. The soul has an instinct for its own nature, and śraddhā is the activation of that instinct. Tat-para — being entirely absorbed in the spiritual goal — describes the one-pointed life of the sincere devotee-yogi who has made God the central fact of existence. Saṃyatendriya — controlled senses — is the practical result of pranayama and inner withdrawal; the life-force, no longer dissipated through senses, pools in the spine and brain, creating the luminous clarity through which jñāna dawns. The supreme peace (parāṃ śāntim) Yogananda identifies with the profound stillness of nirvikalpa samādhi — not unconsciousness but pure awareness resting in itself.","goyandka":"Goyandka enumerates these three qualifications as the minimal necessary conditions for receiving jñāna. Śraddhā: without faith in the teacher, the teaching, and the possibility of liberation, the teaching cannot penetrate. Tat-para: distracted pursuit of many goals prevents the inner concentration needed for wisdom to crystallize. Saṃyatendriya: sense control frees the energy of attention for the inner inquiry. When all three are present, jñāna is attained — labhate jñānam. The use of the present tense (labhate) rather than the future is deliberate: when these qualities exist, knowledge follows as a natural consequence, not as a distant hope. The result — supreme peace — is the hallmark that jñāna has been truly received and not merely intellectually grasped."}},{"verse":40,"sanskrit":"अज्ञश्चाश्रद्दधानश्च संशयात्मा विनश्यति ।\\nनायं लोकोऽस्ति न परो न सुखं संशयात्मनः ॥","transliteration":"ajñaś cāśraddadhānaś ca saṃśayātmā vinaśyati\\nnāyaṃ loko 'sti na paro na sukhaṃ saṃśayātmanaḥ","translation":"The spiritually ignorant, the faithless, and above all the soul whose very identity has become chronic doubt — all such remain imprisoned in the suffering they might otherwise transcend.

He is not condemning these people — He is describing what happens when doubt becomes one's very identity, one's ātman. Notice the three: ajña is one who simply has not yet learned — that is forgivable and remediable. Aśraddadhāna is one who has heard but refused to receive — more serious but still capable of turning. But saṃśayātmā — the one whose very self has become identified with doubt — that is the deepest danger. Such a person can find peace neither in the world of action nor in the world of contemplation. Doubt as an occasional guest is healthy; doubt as a permanent resident destroys the capacity for both worldly and spiritual fulfillment. This is the sternest love a parent can show — 'Child, your cleverness will be your undoing if you cannot learn to trust.'","sarvapriyananda":"The verse presents a graduated scale of spiritual incapacity. Ajña — the ignorant — lacks the discriminative capacity (viveka) to distinguish real from unreal, permanent from impermanent. Aśraddadhāna — the faithless — possesses intellect but withholds trust from the teaching and the teacher, treating all spiritual knowledge as merely provisional opinion. Saṃśayātmā — one whose entire self is doubt — is the most tragic: the habitual doubter whose every aspiration is immediately eroded by second-guessing. In Advaita, doubt (saṃśaya) is one of the primary functions of a disturbed intellect (vikṣipta antaḥkaraṇa). Such a person cannot act effectively in the world (na ayaṃ lokaḥ) nor access higher states (na paraḥ). Happiness (sukha) requires that the mind rest somewhere — the doubter's mind finds no resting place.","yogananda":"Yogananda viewed habitual doubt as the primary obstacle to spiritual realization — more damaging than passion or anger, because those emotions at least contain energy. Doubt is a form of spiritual paralysis. The saṃśayātmā analyzed here is not the sincere questioner who seeks clarity — the previous verse endorsed sincere inquiry (paripraśna). This is the cynic who has made doubt itself into a philosophy, who refuses every answer offered and uses apparent intellectual rigor to avoid genuine commitment to practice. Such a person cannot progress, because every spiritual teaching requires a leap of initial trust that is then confirmed through direct experience. Without that initial leap, experience never comes and trust never builds — a vicious circle of spiritual stagnation.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary carefully distinguishes the three types. Ajña: one who has had no access to knowledge — their destruction is through ignorance alone. Aśraddadhāna: one who has had access to teaching but lacks the receptive faith to receive it — their problem is attitudinal. Saṃśayātmā: one who may have knowledge and even some faith, but whose chronic doubt prevents either from bearing fruit — this is the most dangerous condition. The word vinaśyati is sobering: perishes. Not merely fails to progress, but is actively destroyed by this inner state. Na ayaṃ lokaḥ: unable to succeed in worldly life (because no sustained effort is possible without some faith). Na paraḥ: unable to attain the higher life. Na sukham: unable to enjoy even basic contentment. Doubt corrodes everything it touches."}},{"verse":41,"sanskrit":"योगसन्न्यस्तकर्माणं ज्ञानसञ्छिन्नसंशयम् ।\\nआत्मवन्तं न कर्माणि निबध्नन्ति धनञ्जय ॥","transliteration":"yoga-sannyasta-karmāṇaṃ jñāna-sañchinna-saṃśayam\\nātmavantaṃ na karmāṇi nibadhnanti dhanaṃjaya","translation":"O Dhananjaya, the illumined soul who has offered all action into the sacred fire of yoga — whose doubt has been severed at the root by the swift blade of divine Self-knowledge — who dwells established in the sovereign fullness of the Soul — such a liberated one moves freely through all activity of life, and no action, however vast, casts a single chain around the eternally free Spirit within.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch04/verse_04_41.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"योगसन्न्यस्तकर्माणम्","transliteration":"yoga-sannyasta-karmāṇam","root":"yoga + sam + ni + √as (to throw, to cast off) + karman (action)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"one who has renounced actions through yoga / who has cast off karma via yoga"},{"word":"ज्ञानसञ्छिन्नसंशयम्","transliteration":"jñāna-sañchinna-saṃśayam","root":"√jñā (to know) + sam + √chid (to cut) + saṃśaya (doubt)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"whose doubt has been completely cut by knowledge"},{"word":"आत्मवन्तम्","transliteration":"ātmavantam","root":"ātman (Self) + suffix -vat (possessing)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"self-possessed / one who possesses the Self / established in the Self"},{"word":"निबध्नन्ति","transliteration":"nibadhnanti","root":"ni + √bandh (to bind, to tie)","grammatical_form":"Verb, present tense, 3rd person plural","meaning":"bind / tie / fetter"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Look at the portrait Krishna draws of the free person, dear one — three strokes and complete. First: yoga-sannyasta-karmāṇam — one who has offered all actions into the fire of yoga, not clinging to a single result. Second: jñāna-sañchinna-saṃśayam — one whose doubt has been cut clean, not suppressed or argued away but surgically removed by the sword of knowledge. Third: ātmavantam — one who possesses the Self, who has found their true home. Such a person can do anything — even go to war — and karma does not cling to them. They are like a lotus in the pond: fully immersed but not wet. This is the state Dadaji used to call 'in the world but not of it' — not a withdrawal from life but a transformation of one's relationship to it.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse synthesizes the entire teaching of Chapter 4 in three compound descriptors. Yoga-sannyasta-karmāṇam: the renunciation of action through yoga does not mean inaction but the inner abandonment of doership — 'I am not the doer.' Jñāna-sañchinna-saṃśayam: doubt is not merely allayed or managed but sañchinna — completely cut, like a rope severed. The imagery of cutting will be taken up again in verse 42 with the sword metaphor. Ātmavantam: the one who is ātmavān is not scattered in external pursuits but centered in the Self — literally 'possessing the ātman,' or better, 'abiding as the ātman.' For such a person, actions continue — the body moves, the world is served — but the karmic mechanism does not engage because there is no ego-self to be its substrate.","yogananda":"Yogananda's commentary on this verse would center on the word ātmavantam — the one who is established in the Self. The realized yogi performs all actions — meditation, teaching, healing, even apparently ordinary activities — from the center of inner stillness. The actions arise from the universal Self, not from the limited personal ego. Therefore they create no karmic residue, just as a mirror creates no image of its own when reflecting the world. The doubt that has been 'cut by knowledge' is the deepest existential uncertainty — 'Am I the body? Am I the mind? What happens when I die?' — all of which dissolve in the light of direct Self-realization. With that dissolution, the fear-based compulsive doing that creates binding karma also dissolves.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary notes that this verse stands in direct contrast to verse 40. There, the doubting self (saṃśayātmā) perishes; here, the one whose doubt is cut (sañchinna-saṃśaya) is free from all bondage. The contrast is complete. The three qualities described here are not sequential conditions but simultaneous descriptions of the same inner state: renunciation through yoga, annihilation of doubt through knowledge, and establishment in the Self are one integrated reality, not three separate achievements. When any one is fully realized, the others follow. Karma does not bind such a one — nibadhnanti in the present tense indicates a permanent, ongoing freedom, not a temporary relief. The liberation is here and now, not postponed."}},{"verse":42,"sanskrit":"तस्मादज्ञानसम्भूतं हृत्स्थं ज्ञानासिनात्मनः ।\\nछित्त्वैनं संशयं योगमातिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ भारत ॥","transliteration":"tasmād ajñāna-sambhūtaṃ hṛt-sthaṃ jñānāsinātmanaḥ\\nchittvainaṃ saṃśayaṃ yogam ātiṣṭhottiṣṭha bhārata","translation":"Therefore, O Bharata — beloved child of a noble lineage — take up the shining sword of Self-knowledge and sever cleanly this doubt born of spiritual ignorance that has made its home in the sacred chamber of your heart.

Tasmāt — therefore — because of everything that has been said. The doubt that paralyzes you is sitting right there in your heart, born of ignorance about your true nature. Krishna does not say 'think about cutting it' or 'perhaps try to cut it' — He says chittvā, 'having cut it,' as if it is already done, as if you already have the capacity. Use the sword of knowledge. And then: ātiṣṭha yogam uttiṣṭha — take up yoga and arise. These two commands together are so beautiful. First the inner work: take your stand in yoga, in the discipline of inner alignment. Then the outer expression: arise. Get up. Move. Fight your battle. This is the Gītā's answer to despair — not reassurance, but a sword, a path, and a command.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse is the grand conclusion of Chapter 4 and carries immense force. Four elements: (1) Tasmāt — the conclusion follows from all that has been taught. (2) The doubt is identified precisely: ajñāna-sambhūtam (born of ignorance), hṛt-stham (dwelling in the heart — not peripheral but central). (3) The instrument is named: jñānāsinā ātmanaḥ — the sword of Self-knowledge, knowledge of the ātman. (4) The dual command: ātiṣṭha yogam — take your stand in yoga; uttiṣṭha — arise. The movement from inner to outer is deliberate: first establish yourself in the yoga of wisdom and equanimity, then act from that established ground. This is the integration the Gītā offers — not mysticism divorced from action but wisdom fused with engaged life.","yogananda":"This closing verse of Chapter 4 is one of the Gītā's most electrifying moments. The doubt that Arjuna carries — 'Who am I? What is right? What is real?' — is identified as hṛt-stham, dwelling in the heart itself. The heart is the seat of the ego, and the ego is constituted by exactly this doubt about the true Self. The sword of jñāna — the razor of discriminating wisdom, cultivated through meditation and inquiry — is the one instrument that can cut this knot. Once cut — ātiṣṭha yogam, resort to yoga; make yoga the basis of your life. And then uttiṣṭha — arise. This final command echoes from the beginning of the Gītā to its end. Yogananda would say: rise in consciousness, rise in love, rise in action. Arise from the dream of limitation into the wakefulness of your divine nature.","goyandka":"The Gita Press tradition reads this closing verse as the perfect summary of the Gītā's practical teaching for Arjuna — and for every aspirant. Saṃśaya (doubt) is not an intellectual problem; it is a defect of the antaḥkaraṇa (inner instrument) arising directly from ajñāna (ignorance of the Self). It dwells in the hṛdaya (heart/center of being) — not on the surface but at the core. Only the sword of ātma-jñāna — direct Self-knowledge — can reach and sever this deep-seated knot. The command ātiṣṭha yogam is not merely 'practice yoga exercises' but 'take your fundamental stand in the discipline of Self-realization.' Uttiṣṭha — arise — is then not merely a military command but a spiritual declaration: arise from the sleep of ignorance. Bharata — O descendant of Bharata — recalls Arjuna's noble lineage and the standard of courage and truth it demands."}}]`),t={chapter:4,verses:e};export{a as chapter,t as default,e as verses};
