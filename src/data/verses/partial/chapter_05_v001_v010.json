        "dadaji": "Arjuna's question is not born of confusion alone — it is born of sincerity. He has heard Krishna praise both paths, and like an earnest student, he wants clarity. Dadaji often said that this question echoes in the heart of every genuine seeker: should I leave everything and meditate, or should I continue living and working in the world? Krishna's answer will dissolve the apparent contradiction by revealing that the outer form of life matters far less than the inner attitude. The word 'suniścitam' — with certainty — reveals that Arjuna wants not philosophy but guidance he can actually live by.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse opens the fifth chapter with a question that has vexed spiritual seekers for millennia. Arjuna is asking about the apparent tension between the jñāna-niṣṭhā (path of knowledge and renunciation) and karma-yoga (path of action). In Vedantic analysis, this is the question of the qualified candidate: am I suited for monasticism, or for engaged action in the world? Krishna's answer across the next verses establishes that both lead to the same liberation — but for most people in the world, karma yoga is more accessible and thus more effective.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda saw Arjuna's question as a question that lives in every soul that begins to awaken. The outer seeker wants to know: which path? But the deeper answer is that the path is inner, not outer. Renunciation that is merely external — abandoning the world in body while remaining attached in mind — is not true sannyāsa. Karma yoga practiced with inner detachment achieves the same freedom while remaining in the midst of life. Yogananda taught that the highest renunciation is of ego and desire, not of activity.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka notes that Arjuna's question arises because in Chapter 3, Krishna had already established karma yoga as superior to mere inaction, and had praised both paths in different contexts. The word 'punar' (again) indicates that Arjuna has heard this teaching before and still feels the tension. The classical tradition holds that sannyāsa in its highest form is a state of inner being, not an external condition. Arjuna's request for a 'suniścita' (definitive) answer shows spiritual maturity — he wants realization, not academic debate."

        "dadaji": "Krishna's answer is diplomatic and deep at once. Both paths lead to liberation — that is the first reassurance. But then He says karma yoga excels. Dadaji always emphasized that this is not a dismissal of sannyāsa; it is a recognition of what is practically and spiritually accessible to most human beings. A karma yogi in the world, with family, work, and responsibilities — if he acts without attachment — is performing a deeper renunciation than someone who has merely changed their outer circumstances. Real detachment is proved in the midst of life, not in its absence.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Krishna's comparative statement 'karma-yogo viśiṣyate' — karma yoga is superior — is carefully qualified: it is superior to 'karma-saṃnyāsa' — the mere renunciation of action. This is not a dismissal of jñāna-niṣṭhā (the path of knowledge for renunciants) but a specific comparison with its pale imitation: the outer abandonment of work without inner transformation. For Vedanta, both paths converge in the same realization of non-dual Self. The superiority of karma yoga is pedagogical and practical — it suits the vast majority of sincere seekers who live in the world.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda interpreted this verse through the lens of practical spirituality: both paths lead to God, but karma yoga — engaged action offered to God — is more suitable for the active temperament that most souls possess. The key word is 'niḥśreyasa-karau' — both produce the highest good. God does not require us to renounce the world; He requires us to renounce our attachment to it. A mother caring for her child with love, a worker doing their job as service — these are karma yogis performing what Yogananda called 'the yoga of activity.'",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary emphasizes that 'niḥśreyas' — the highest good — means moksha, liberation itself, not merely heavenly reward. Both paths truly lead to this ultimate goal. The superiority of karma yoga over mere renunciation rests on the principle that action performed without attachment purifies the mind more actively than inaction. Goyandka notes that this verse does not contradict the Upanishadic praise of sannyāsa — it specifies that the karma yoga it compares is action performed in the spirit of full renunciation. The inner attitude is the decisive factor in both cases."

        "dadaji": "This is one of the most liberating verses in the Geeta. Dadaji would say: you do not need to change your outer life to be a true sannyāsi — you need to change your inner life. The real renunciant is not one who has abandoned home and family, but one who has abandoned hatred and desire. 'Na dveṣṭi na kāṅkṣati' — these six syllables contain the entire practice. Observe your mind: does it push away what it dislikes, does it chase what it wants? That movement of push and pull is bondage. When it stills, you are free — not in some future life, but in this very moment.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Krishna here redefines sannyāsa from an institutional status to an internal condition. The 'nitya-saṃnyāsī' — the eternal renunciant — is characterized not by a robe or a monastery but by the complete cessation of dveṣa (aversion) and kāṅkṣā (craving). In Vedantic analysis, these two — rāga (attraction) and dveṣa (repulsion) — are the fundamental movements of the conditioned mind that generate all karma and all bondage. When they cease, what remains is the pure Self. The phrase 'sukhaṃ pramucyate' — is easily liberated — is extraordinary: for the one who is already free within, liberation is not a distant goal but an immediate recognition.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda saw in this verse the psychological key to liberation: dveṣa (aversion) and kāṅkṣā (craving) are the two poles of the ego's constant agitation. Every moment of suffering can be traced to either 'I don't want this' or 'I want that.' The nirdvandva — one who is beyond the pairs of opposites — is not someone who feels nothing, but one whose inner center is not disturbed by the pushes and pulls of circumstance. This is the state of even-mindedness, samātva, which Yogananda called the first fruit of meditation: equanimity in the face of pleasure and pain, gain and loss, praise and blame.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka's commentary notes that 'nitya-saṃnyāsī' — eternal renunciant — is a key designation. Sannyāsa here is not temporal or conditional — it is the permanent inner state of one who has uprooted the twin roots of bondage: rāga (craving) and dveṣa (aversion). These two together are called the dvandvas — the pairs of opposites — because they always arise together: wherever there is craving there is also aversion, wherever there is love for the pleasant there is fear of the unpleasant. Liberation ('pramucyate' — is completely released) comes naturally, easily ('sukham'), to one established in this inner renunciation. The outer form of life is secondary."

        "dadaji": "Those who argue fiercely about which path is superior — knowledge or action, monasticism or engaged life — are called 'bālāḥ' — children — by Krishna. Dadaji found this teaching deeply reassuring: both paths, when pursued with genuine sincerity and depth ('samyak' — properly, fully), lead to the same liberation. The argument about paths is itself a distraction. A seeker who goes deeply into either karma yoga or jñāna yoga will naturally arrive at the same truth: the ego is not the doer, the Self is the silent witness, and there is ultimately only Brahman. The paths look different at their surface but converge completely at their depths.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse resolves the philosophical debate between the Pūrva Mīmāṃsakas who championed karma and the Vedāntins who championed jñāna. Krishna's answer — that they are not truly separate — is the hallmark of the Geeta's integrative vision. 'Samyag āsthitaḥ' — properly established — is the crucial qualifier. A karma yogi who acts in the spirit of full surrender and non-attachment is, in his inner life, a jñānī. A jñānī who has truly realized the Self spontaneously acts without ego. At the summit, the two paths are one summit. The difference is only in the approach and temperament of the seeker.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda often quoted this verse to dissolve the pride that spiritual seekers sometimes feel about their chosen path. The meditator who looks down on the karma yogi, or the karma yogi who dismisses inner contemplation — both are 'bālāḥ,' immature. Yogananda's own life demonstrated this unity: he was a profound meditator and a tireless worker who founded institutions, wrote, taught, and served ceaselessly. He called this 'the Yoga of activity united with the yoga of meditation.' Either path, pursued 'samyak' — with complete dedication and the right inner attitude — yields the full fruit of liberation.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka's Gita Press analysis emphasizes the word 'samyak' (properly/completely) as the decisive qualifier. Neither sankhya nor yoga yields its full fruit when practiced superficially. The Sāṃkhya path requires not just intellectual study of the scriptures but a complete purification of the understanding (vijñāna) that results in the direct apprehension of the Self. The Yoga path requires not just external action but internal non-attachment so total that no karma is accumulated. When either is pursued to this depth, the seeker finds that the other path is implicit within it. Wisdom (jñāna) and desireless action (karma yoga) are the two sides of the same liberation."

Dadaji called this the Geeta's way of marking a teaching as especially important: the repetition of the verb. The one who sees sankhya and yoga as one — not as academic opinion but as living experience — has truly seen the nature of reality. What does it mean to see them as one? It means to see that all sincere paths, all genuine spiritual effort, are movements toward the same light. There is only one truth, and all authentic paths are approaches to it from different directions.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The statement 'sa paśyati' — he sees — in Vedantic language refers not to ordinary perception but to the direct vision of the Self (ātma-sākṣātkāra). The 'sthāna' — the state or abode — that both sāṃkhyas and yogis reach is brahma-sthiti, establishment in Brahman. This is not a place but a state of being. The one who sees the two paths as one does so not through philosophical reasoning but through the identity of their destination. When both paths have run their full course, they arrive at the same shore. The insistence on the superiority of one over the other belongs to the beginning of the path, not its end.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda saw this verse as a vision of spiritual unity that transcends all sectarian debate. He who sees Sankhya and Yoga as one has the vision of the sage — he sees behind the apparent multiplicity of teachings to the single truth that all teachings point toward. This is not relativism — not all paths are equally efficient — but it is the recognition that at their summit, all genuine paths of self-purification and self-surrender arrive at the same realization: 'I am not this body-mind; I am the eternal, ever-blissful Self.' The repetition 'yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati' signals this as a statement of realized knowledge, not mere theory.",
        "goyandka": "The word 'sthāna' — state or standing-place — is interpreted in Gita Press commentary as moksha, liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Both the Sāṃkhya path (pursuit of discriminative knowledge leading to the recognition that the Purusha is distinct from Prakṛti, and ultimately identical with Brahman) and the Yoga path (desireless action as worship leading to purification and jñāna) converge on this single sthāna. He who sees their unity is the one whose perception has penetrated to the level of their common goal. This verse is a call to transcend intellectual partisanship and fix the gaze on the destination rather than the method."

Dadaji often said that people who rush into outer renunciation without inner preparation frequently find themselves more miserable — and more attached — than before. The monkey mind does not become quiet simply because the body sits still. Karma yoga is the preparation: through disciplined action without attachment, the mind is purified, desires are weakened, and the inner stillness of true renunciation becomes natural rather than forced.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse contains an important pedagogical principle: sannyāsa as an inner state of non-attachment ('yoga') must precede and accompany formal sannyāsa as an outer condition. Without the inner yoga — the cultivation of desirelessness, equanimity, and self-knowledge through karma yoga — outer renunciation cannot bear its fruit. The 'yoga-yukta muni' — the sage who is united with yoga — attains Brahman 'na cireṇa' — without delay, quickly. This 'na cireṇa' is remarkable: it suggests that when the inner preparation is complete, liberation is immediate, not a future event. The muni has already arrived.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda read this verse as a practical warning against premature renunciation. Many seekers, on first tasting spiritual aspiration, want to abandon all worldly responsibilities immediately. But if the ego has not been purified through karma yoga — through service, devotion, and action offered to God — renunciation tends to produce spiritual pride, escapism, and subtle forms of the very attachment it was meant to overcome. The yoga-yukta muni — the sage established in the yoga of inner union — is free within. For such a one, liberation comes 'without delay' because it is not a future attainment but the recognition of one's ever-present nature.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary draws a sharp distinction between formal sannyāsa (the external institution of monastic renunciation) and the inner state of vairāgya (dispassion) that karma yoga cultivates. Formal renunciation without vairāgya is, as Krishna says, 'duḥkham āptum' — painful to achieve and painful to maintain. The agitation of the unsubdued mind does not cease merely because one's outer life has changed. But the karma yogi who has steadily practiced non-attachment in the midst of the world arrives at a genuine vairāgya — a dispassion born not of suppression but of understanding. From this foundation, Brahman-realization comes swiftly."

        "dadaji": "This verse describes the four-fold qualification of the karma yogi who acts without karma: purified self (viśuddhātmā), conquered self (vijitātmā), mastered senses (jitendriyaḥ), and the crown — sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā — one whose Self has expanded to encompass all beings. Dadaji called this last quality the fruit of all spiritual practice: when you no longer experience yourself as a separate entity competing with others, but as the same Self present in all, then action no longer generates karma. You act for all beings as you would act for yourself. This is not philosophy but a lived experience of universal identity.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse presents a sequence of inner achievements that characterize the liberated karma yogi. Notice the progression: yoga-yukta (united with yoga) → viśuddhātmā (purified self) → vijitātmā (conquered ego-self) → jitendriyaḥ (mastered senses) → sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā (self-identified with the Self in all beings). The last compound is the climax: it describes the Vedantic realization of non-duality — the understanding that there is only one Self appearing in all forms. For such a one, 'na lipyate' — no karmic taint accrues — because there is no separate ego to be the beneficiary or victim of karma. Action flows from the universal Self and returns to it.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda saw in 'sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā' the highest realization of yoga: cosmic consciousness, in which the individual soul knows itself as identical with the universal Soul. When you truly feel the Self in all beings and all beings in your Self, you cannot act selfishly — because there is no 'other' to be selfish toward. Every action becomes an act of love for one's own expanded Self. This is why such a person, though acting continuously, is untouched by karma — the engine of karma, the sense of 'I' and 'mine' acting for a separate self, has been dissolved in the fire of cosmic love.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka carefully analyzes all five compound qualities listed here. 'Viśuddhātmā' means the inner instrument (antaḥkaraṇa — mind, intellect, ego) has been purified of desire and delusion. 'Vijitātmā' means the lower self (the restless mind) has been brought under the governance of the higher intelligence. 'Jitendriyaḥ' means the senses no longer run after their objects uncontrolled. The final quality — sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā — is the spontaneous result of the preceding three: when the self is purified and the senses are mastered, the vision of the Self in all beings naturally unfolds. In this state, 'na lipyate' — no karma attaches — because action is performed as an offering to the omnipresent Self."

        "dadaji": "This verse, continuing into verse 9, is one of the most practically revolutionary teachings in the Geeta. Krishna describes the uninterrupted inner witness of the tattva-vit — the knower of truth. He goes through all the ordinary activities of life: seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing — and says, through all of these, the wise one holds the knowledge 'I do nothing.' Dadaji would ask: who is seeing? Not the ego — the ego is a construct, an apparent center. Seeing happens through the sense-organ of the eye, which is an instrument of Prakriti. The true Self, the witness, neither sees nor hears — it simply shines as the light by which all experience is known.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Verses 8 and 9 together constitute what Vedanta calls the 'akartā-bhāva' — the identity as non-doer. The tattva-vit knows that all action belongs to the body-mind complex, which is itself a manifestation of Prakriti (nature). The Purusha — the true Self — is the pure, unmoving witness. The list of activities in verses 8-9 is comprehensive and deliberate: it covers all the sense-organs, all the motor organs, and even involuntary functions like breathing and sleeping. No activity is excluded from this understanding. The knower of truth maintains this witness-awareness not as an intellectual position but as a living, constant recognition.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda called this the 'neti, neti' of action — not this, not this. As each activity arises, the yogi says inwardly: 'I, the soul, am not seeing — the eyes see. I am not eating — the body eats. I am not sleeping — the body-mind sleeps.' This is not a game or a denial — it is the practice of constant identity with the witness-Self. Yogananda taught that when this practice deepens in meditation, there comes an actual experience of watching the body and mind from within, as a silent observer. This experience of the witness is the doorway to the realization of pure consciousness.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka's commentary notes that the list in verses 8-9 covers all five jñānendriyāṇi (sense organs: sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste), all pañca-karmendriyas (organs of action: going/movement, speaking — in verse 9, grasping, releasing), and even involuntary functions (breathing, sleeping). The exhaustive list makes the point total: in every possible type of activity, the tattva-vit maintains the knowledge 'na kiñcit karomi' — I do nothing. This is the highest form of karma sannyāsa: not abandoning actions but abandoning the doership — the ego-identification with action. This does not lead to passivity but to completely pure action."

        "dadaji": "This verse completes the thought begun in verse 8, and the concluding phrase is the key to the whole: 'indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu vartanta iti dhārayan' — holding the conviction that the senses move among sense objects. The tattva-vit does not suppress the senses, does not flee from experience — he remains fully in life, speaking, releasing, grasping, blinking — but he holds with unshakeable conviction the knowledge that the senses do their work according to their own nature, while the true Self remains untouched. Dadaji called this 'inner witness consciousness' — the ability to be fully present in life while simultaneously resting in the unmoving ground of awareness that underlies all activity.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The word 'dhārayan' — holding firmly — is crucial. This is not a passive belief but an active maintenance of witness-identity throughout all activity. In Vedantic sādhana (practice), this is called 'sākṣī-bhāva' — the attitude of the pure witness. The indriyāṇi (sense-organs) naturally move among indriyārthāṣu (sense-objects) — this is their function in Prakriti's economy. The Purusha, the pure Self, is neither the sense-organ nor the sense-object nor the contact between them — it is the witness of all three. 'Iti dhārayan' — holding this conviction — is the essence of jñāna yoga practiced in the midst of karma yoga.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda saw verses 8-9 as the scriptural foundation for what he called 'practicing the presence of God.' While the body speaks, eats, moves, and blinks — all involuntary and voluntary activities continue — the soul remains in God, as God's witness. This is not dissociation from life but the deepest participation in it — full action with full inner freedom. Yogananda taught that this state is not reserved for renunciants: the householder, the student, the worker — anyone who practices inner non-identification with the ego can hold this dharana (steadfast conviction) through all the activities of daily life.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka's commentary on verse 9 emphasizes 'dhārayan' as the technical term for a continuous meditative conviction that is maintained without interruption. The Sāṃkhya-Yoga tradition holds that all action belongs to Prakriti — the field of nature — while the Purusha (or in Vedantic terms, the Ātman) is ever the uninvolved witness. The senses move because it is their nature to move — 'indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu vartante' is a description of an impersonal process, like a river flowing. The jñānī does not fight this process; he simply knows he is not it. In this knowing, complete freedom (mukti) is already present."

        "dadaji": "The lotus leaf in water — this is perhaps the most beautiful image in the Geeta for the karma yogi's life in the world. Dadaji loved this metaphor deeply. The lotus does not fight the water. It does not jump out of the pond to stay dry. It rests on the water, grows in the water, blooms above the water — and yet not a drop clings to it. This is the spiritual ideal: live fully in the world, take on all your responsibilities, act with complete commitment — but let none of it cling to you. Offer every action to Brahman, release every outcome, and remain as untouched within as the lotus leaf is on the surface.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse presents the two pillars of karma yoga in a single line: 'brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi' — offering all actions to Brahman — and 'saṅgaṃ tyaktvā' — abandoning attachment. These two are the complete technique. The offering to Brahman dissolves the ego's claim of authorship over action; the abandonment of saṅga dissolves the ego's claim over the fruits of action. When both are present, karma yoga is complete. The lotus-leaf simile is one of the most celebrated in Sanskrit literature: the lotus leaf's surface has a quality (lotus-effect, as modern science calls it) that causes water droplets to roll off without wetting. The liberated soul has a similar 'quality' — action and its results simply do not adhere.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda called verse 10 the practical summary of the entire fifth chapter. Two actions, two results: offer your actions to God (brahmaṇy ādhāya) and abandon attachment (saṅgaṃ tyaktvā) — and no sin, no karma, no bondage can touch you. The lotus-leaf image was one of his favorites. He taught that we should be 'waterproof souls' — fully immersed in life and relationships and duties, but with an inner quality of non-attachment that allows no experience to leave a permanent mark of craving or aversion. This is not coldness but perfect freedom in the midst of complete engagement.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary on this celebrated verse emphasizes the compound action: 'brahmaṇy ādhāya' is not a single act of dedication performed once, but a continuous orientation of the will — every action, moment by moment, offered to the Lord as a form of Brahman. 'Saṅgaṃ tyaktvā' is the internal complement: attachment (the sense that 'I' am doing this and 'I' will enjoy or suffer the result) is continuously relinquished. The lotus-leaf simile is exact: just as the lotus leaf's nature prevents water from sticking, the karma yogi's inner nature — cultivated through continuous offering and non-attachment — prevents sin (pāpa, negative karma) from adhering. This is the liberation that is available here and now, in this very life."
