        "dadaji": "Beloved, see how the Lord describes the torment of a life lived without God — boundless anxiety, with no relief until death itself. When kāma-bhoga is treated as the highest goal, the heart finds no rest; every desire fulfilled only births ten more. Sri Krishna is not condemning the demoniac soul with harshness but with compassion, showing us the precise anatomy of suffering so we may recognise it and turn away. As long as we cling to 'this is all there is,' the nectar of the Divine remains beyond our reach.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "From the Vedantic standpoint, 'etāvad iti niścitāḥ' — 'this is all there is' — is the definitive statement of avidyā. The demoniac personality has metaphysically foreclosed the Infinite: Brahman, the unlimited Consciousness behind all experience, has been denied. What remains is a finite bundle of wants and fears navigating a finite world, which is precisely why the anxiety is 'aparimeyā' — unmeasurable — because finite objects can never satisfy the infinite hunger of Ātman misidentified with the body-mind. The suffering described here is not punishment but the natural consequence of mistaken identity.",
        "yogananda": "The inner life of the materialist is a restless sea of cravings, each wave of fulfillment followed immediately by a deeper trough of want. 'Pralayāntām' — this anxiety persists until bodily death — because the soul has shut the inner door to the divine peace that passes understanding. Master taught that sense-pleasures are like salt water: the more one drinks, the greater the thirst. These souls have convinced themselves that the sensory surface of existence is its entirety, and so they never dive deep enough to find the inexhaustible spring of joy that waits within.",
        "goyandka": "This verse characterises the āsurī temperament by its psychic constitution: 'cintām aparimeyām' denotes the chronic, structurally unresolvable anxiety that arises when one has no transcendent anchor. 'Pralayāntām upāśritāḥ' — clinging to this anxiety-ridden mode right up to death — indicates that no earthly experience will break the pattern; only divine grace or a fundamental re-orientation of value can do so. The philosophical error is declared in 'etāvad iti niścitāḥ': the empirical world is taken as exhaustive of reality, thereby closing off the Vedic teaching on Ātman and Brahman. This verse is the psychological root from which the behaviours of the following verses spring."

        "dadaji": "Sri Krishna gives us one of the most vivid images in all of sacred literature: 'āśā-pāśa-śataiḥ' — hundreds of nooses of hope. Each hope we place in the world becomes a rope that binds us. Yet this bondage is self-chosen, not imposed from without. The Lord observes that kāma and krodha travel together: unfulfilled desire becomes anger, and anger drives the soul to seize by unjust means what it could not obtain by fair ones. How different is the divine path, where surrender to God loosens every rope and the devotee walks free.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The compound 'āśā-pāśa' is remarkably precise: āśā (hope, expectation) becomes a pāśa (noose, fetter). In Vedantic analysis, kāma arises from the superimposition of happiness upon external objects; the āsurī mind multiplies these superimpositions endlessly — hence 'śataiḥ,' hundreds of them. Krodha is the inevitable companion, as the Gita establishes in Chapter 2 (verse 62-63): frustrated desire produces anger. The cycle is self-perpetuating — injustice produces more enemies, more obstacles, more krodha, more desire for redress — a perfect description of saṃsāra-bondage at the psychological level.",
        "yogananda": "Every unfulfilled wish is indeed a rope around the soul's wings. The āsurī personality does not see that each hope placed in perishable objects ties another knot; they only feel the pull toward the next acquisition, the next conquest. Paramahansa Yogananda taught that desires are like waves: you cannot still the ocean by riding each wave to shore; you must dive beneath the surface to the calm depths of samādhi. The 'hundreds of ropes' are not external chains — they are the mind's own constructions, and only the wisdom of non-attachment can dissolve them.",
        "goyandka": "This verse logically follows the preceding one: those who are convinced that sense-enjoyment is the highest goal (v11) will naturally find themselves bound by āśā — the expectation of future enjoyment — multiplied into hundreds of entanglements. 'Kāma-krodha-parāyaṇāḥ' identifies the two great vices Krishna named in Chapter 3 (v37) as the 'great enemy born of rajas.' The ethical consequence follows directly: 'anyāyena artha-sañcayān' — wealth amassed by improper means. Where kāma is unbounded and krodha is unchecked, dharma becomes the first casualty. These two verses (11-12) form a complete psychological-ethical portrait of the āsurī driven life."

        "dadaji": "Here Sri Krishna places us inside the mind of the āsurī soul with extraordinary intimacy — we hear the inner voice of possessiveness in its purest form. 'Idam... idam... idam...' — this, this, this — the entire inner world reduced to a catalogue of acquisitions past and future. There is no God in this interior, no gratitude, no wonder — only accounting. Yet how recognisable this voice is! The Lord shows us this mirror not to shame us but to wake us, so we may replace 'mayā labdham' (gained by me) with 'tvayā dattam' (given by Thee) and find freedom in that surrender.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is a masterful depiction of what Vedanta calls ahaṃkāra-driven cognition — every experience is immediately processed through the filter of 'mine' and 'not yet mine.' Note the temporal sweep: past ('labdham'), present ('asti'), and future ('bhaviṣyati') are all colonised by the possessive 'me' (mayā / me). The Ātman, which is the witness of all experience, has been completely identified with the body-mind-ego complex. Śaṅkara notes that this kind of thinking — 'I am the doer, I am the possessor' — is the very definition of avidyā in its functional expression.",
        "yogananda": "The inner monologue Krishna transcribes here is one that advanced meditators learn to observe and dissolve. Every 'I have obtained' and 'I shall obtain' is a ripple of ego-consciousness on the calm surface of the Self. Master taught that the cure for possessiveness is to see yourself as the divine instrument — 'not I but God through me.' When this realisation deepens in meditation, the anxious inner accountant of this verse falls silent, replaced by a deep gratitude in which all things are received as gifts from the Beloved.",
        "goyandka": "Verses 13-15 constitute what classical commentators recognise as the inner soliloquy (sva-gata-bhāṣaṇa) of the āsurī personality, and it is remarkable for what it reveals by its very structure. Every sentence has 'I' or 'mine' as its operative centre. 'Manoratham' — the chariot of the mind — beautifully captures the runaway quality of desire: the mind races forward on the vehicle of want, never resting. The threefold temporal structure of this verse (past acquisition, future desire, present and future wealth) shows that the āsurī mind is never present — it is always grasping, never resting in what is."

        "dadaji": "See how Sri Krishna catalogues the āsurī soul's five delusions in a single verse: I am the slayer, I am the controller, I am the enjoyer, I am the successful one, I am the happy one. Each 'aham' is a false claim — for in truth it is God alone who acts, enjoys, controls, accomplishes, and blesses. The devotee's response to this verse is simply to replace every āsurī 'aham' with 'tvam' — Thou art the Lord, Thou art the enjoyer, Thou art my strength and my joy. That inversion of ego into devotion is the essence of surrender.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse presents what we might call the full inflation of the jīva's ego — the āsurī soul has claimed for the finite self (ahaṃkāra) every attribute that belongs to Brahman alone. 'Īśvaraḥ aham' — I am the Lord — is in fact the highest Vedantic mahāvākya (Aham Brahmāsmi), but uttered here in complete ignorance of its true meaning. The āsurī soul claims lordship of a few acres, a few relationships, a small enterprise — while the true Īśvara is the ground of all existence. It is avidyā wearing the costume of jñāna.",
        "yogananda": "Five claims of the ego are compressed into this half-verse: power over enemies, power over the future, lordship, enjoyment, success, strength, happiness — all claimed exclusively for the small self. Yogananda taught that this is precisely the ego's programme: to appropriate all of God's attributes and apply them to the body-mind. The spiritual path is the systematic reversal of this programme — recognising that all power, all lordship, all true joy belong to the Divine within. Then the statement 'ahaṃ bhogī' transforms into something beautiful: the liberated soul enjoys all experience as God's own delight flowing through a transparent instrument.",
        "goyandka": "The structure of this verse is instructive: it begins with violence ('hataḥ śatruḥ,' 'haniṣye'), moves to claims of divine status ('īśvaraḥ aham'), and ends with the assertion of self-sufficiency ('siddhaḥ, balavān, sukhī'). The escalation is intentional — the āsurī trajectory moves from external domination to internal inflation. 'Īśvaraḥ aham' is the theological root of all subsequent evil: when the individual soul claims divine sovereignty without acknowledging the supreme Īśvara, all dharmic restraints are dissolved. This is why the demoniac nature is ultimately a theological problem, not merely an ethical one."

        "dadaji": "How tenderly Sri Krishna adds 'ajñāna-vimohitāḥ' — deluded by ignorance — at the end of this boastful soliloquy. The Lord does not say 'wicked' or 'evil'; he says 'deluded.' Even the most arrogant soul is ultimately a lost child, confused about its own true nature. The āsurī soul even plans to perform yajña and give dāna — outwardly religious acts — but entirely for self-aggrandisement, for social status, for self-congratulation. True worship begins only when the 'kaḥ anyaḥ sadṛśo mayā' — who equals me — is replaced with 'sarvam khalv idaṃ brahma' — all this is Brahman.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse completes the inner monologue with a devastating irony: the āsurī soul even proposes to perform yajña and give dāna — the very disciplines the Gita recommends — but the motivation is entirely ego-driven, a self-display of superiority. This is the Vedantic concept of avidyā at its subtlest: even dharmic actions can be co-opted by the ego. 'Ko'nyo'sti sadṛśo mayā' — who is equal to me? — reveals that the āsurī soul has no genuine peers, no genuine community, and therefore no genuine love. The ego that inflates to divine size (v14) can have no real relationships.",
        "yogananda": "When the ego performs charity, it gives to see itself giving. When it performs ritual, it worships itself in God's name. This is the spiritual hypocrisy that Yogananda called 'ego-worship' — the most entrenched form of maya. The three verbs here — yakṣye, dāsyāmi, modiṣye — sacrifice, give, rejoice — are all genuinely good actions, but the word 'iti' ('thus thinking') followed by 'ajñāna-vimohitāḥ' ('deluded by ignorance') shows that it is the interior orientation that determines whether these acts liberate or bind. True yajña dissolves the sense of 'I am the doer'; the āsurī yajña reinforces it.",
        "goyandka": "This verse closes the three-verse interior monologue (v13-15) and its final attribution — 'ajñāna-vimohitāḥ' — is the key to understanding the entire passage. Krishna does not characterise the āsurī soul primarily as evil but as deluded. Ajñāna (ignorance of the Ātman's true nature) is the root; the rest — pride, cruelty, injustice, false religion — are its branches. The mention of yajña and dāna is significant: these are Vedic prescribed duties, and even they are corrupted when performed without the śraddhā and the knowledge that the true beneficiary of all worship is the Paramātman dwelling in all."

'Aneka-citta-vibhrāntāḥ' is the opposite of the ekāgratā (one-pointedness) that the Gita prescribes; it is the dissipated mind of which Chapter 2 speaks. 'Moha-jāla' is the net of mithyā-jñāna — false knowledge — that Śaṅkara identifies as the proximate cause of suffering.

Yogananda taught that the whole phenomenal world is such a net, projected by cosmic māyā, and that the yogi's task is to see through it — not by denying experience, but by recognising the divine Consciousness that sustains it. The fall into 'narake'śucau' — impure hell — begins not with dramatic evil but with this quiet addiction to scattered sensory living.",

'Moha-jāla-samāvṛtāḥ' employs the beautiful image of the net (jāla): one does not notice the net until it is drawn tight. 'Narake'śucau' — impure hell — refers both to the post-mortem condition described in the dharmaśāstra literature and, esoterically, to the hellish quality of a life lived in constant desire and delusion, which is itself a form of hell regardless of its external comforts."

But yajña offered in the spirit of dambha — show — is not yajña at all; it is ego-feeding disguised as worship. The great bhaktas teach that the only true sacrifice is the offering of one's ego itself into the fire of divine love. Until that offering is made, all other yajñas are, as Krishna says, in name only.",

'amānitva' in Chapter 13, the first of the divine qualities). 'Stabdhāḥ' — rigidity — is the opposite of the viveka-buddhi that can discriminate and adapt. When ego (ahaṃkāra), wealth (dhana), and pride (māna) combine into mada (intoxication), the intellect is effectively anaesthetised — unable to receive the teaching of the guru or the grace of the Paramātman.",
        "yogananda": "Religion performed for show is one of the subtlest traps on the spiritual path, because it provides the feeling of spiritual life while blocking its substance. Yogananda often warned that the greatest obstacle to God-realisation is not gross sin but spiritual pride — the 'ātma-sambhāvitāḥ' condition. 'Avidhipūrvakam' — not following the prescribed method — points to the fact that true worship has an inner science, a precise method of opening the heart and stilling the ego, which no amount of external performance can substitute. The Kriyā practice is precisely the 'vidhi' — the method — that transforms religious form into living spiritual experience.",
        "goyandka": "This verse addresses the religious dimension of āsurī behaviour — completing the portrait by showing that even the āsurī soul performs the prescribed Vedic acts (yajña), but without the two essential conditions: proper method (vidhi) and proper spirit (śraddhā). 'Dambha' — ostentation — is identified in Chapter 17 as a quality born of rajas and tamas. The distinction between 'nāma-yajña' (nominal sacrifice) and true yajña is the distinction between ritual as social performance and ritual as an act of conscious communion with the divine. Śaṅkara emphasises that 'avidhipūrvakam' disqualifies the act at the root, since the śāstra-prescribed method is the channel through which the yajña reaches its intended cosmic recipients."

        "dadaji": "This verse reveals the innermost theological root of the āsurī condition: they hate God — not in abstract theological dispute, but in every human face they encounter, in every mirror they look into. For the Lord dwells in all hearts (Ch15 v15), and when one hates any being, one hates the Beloved who lives within that being. How many of us carry a trace of this 'pradviṣantaḥ' — not recognising God in the difficult person before us, the challenging situation around us? The remedy Sri Krishna will give us in the next chapters is the very opposite: sarva-bhūteṣu ātmānam — to see the Self in all beings.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This is the culminating verse in the description of the āsurī character, and it is theologically the most significant. 'Mām ātma-para-deheṣu pradviṣantaḥ' — they hate Me in their own and others' bodies — means that hatred of any being is hatred of Brahman, since Brahman is the indwelling Consciousness in all bodies. The Advaita teaching is implicit here: because there is only one Consciousness appearing as many, hatred of another is always ultimately hatred of one's own deepest Self. The āsurī soul, by fragmenting reality into enemies and possessions, wages war upon the very ground of its own being.",
        "yogananda": "The five-fold refuge of the āsurī soul — ego, force, arrogance, desire, anger — is the exact inversion of the divine qualities with which this chapter opens. And the fruit of this inverted refuge is the inability to perceive the Divine in anyone or anything. Yogananda taught that the spiritual eye, when open, sees the light of God in every face; the āsurī eye, clouded by these five veils, sees only competitors, instruments, and enemies. 'Abhyasūyakāḥ' — fault-finders — is the social expression of this spiritual blindness: the person who cannot perceive the sacred in others is compelled to denigrate them.",
        "goyandka": "This verse stands as the theological climax of the āsurī portrait. The five defects listed — ahaṅkāra, bala, darpa, kāma, krodha — are not random vices but a structured descent: ego (ahaṅkāra) produces the claim of independent power (bala), which, threatened, becomes arrogance (darpa), which, frustrated, becomes desire (kāma), which, blocked, becomes anger (krodha). 'Abhyasūyakāḥ' is the same term used in 3.31-32 for those who find fault with the Gita's teaching — linking this verse to a consistent pattern. The verse ends without a main verb — a syntactic break that commentators note points forward to v19 where Krishna delivers the consequence."

        "dadaji": "Sri Krishna speaks here with the authority of cosmic law — and yet the devotee's heart understands this not as a wrathful God punishing enemies but as a loving Father describing the precise fruition of choices made in freedom. The āsurī soul has freely chosen hatred, cruelty, and the rejection of the Divine in all beings; the universe, sustained by the Lord's will, simply reflects those choices back in the form of āsurī births. The same Gita that contains this verse also tells us in Chapter 9 that even the most sinful can cross the ocean of evil by the raft of devotion. The door of bhakti is never closed.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse should be understood in the context of the Vedantic doctrine of karma and rebirth, not as an expression of divine vindictiveness. 'Kṣipāmi ajasram' — I hurl them perpetually — means that the Lord, as the cosmic administrator (jagad-īśvara), maintains the causal order: āsurī consciousness produces āsurī births, which reinforce āsurī tendencies, perpetuating the cycle. This is not punishment imposed from outside; it is the natural unfolding of the law of karma. 'Narādhamān' — the lowest of humans — corresponds to the 'mūḍha' (spiritually blind) category distinguished from the 'jijñāsu' and 'jñānī' in Chapter 7.",
        "yogananda": "Divine justice, in the Vedic-yogic understanding, is not retributive but redemptive — it works through the law of like attracting like. A consciousness soaked in hatred, cruelty, and delusion will naturally gravitate, after death, toward a birth-environment that matches its vibration. 'Āsurīṣu yoniṣu' — demoniac wombs — means environments, families, and circumstances that will reinforce and deepen those tendencies. Yet even here, in the darkest corner of saṃsāra, the Lord dwells as the inner guide. The very suffering of lower births is the universe's merciful pressure to eventually turn the soul Godward.",
        "goyandka": "This verse introduces the concept of yoni (womb, birth-condition) as the mechanism of karmic fruition, a teaching elaborated further in the dharmaśāstra literature. 'Āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu' — into demoniac births specifically — means that the āsurī consciousness does not simply take any birth but gravitates toward conditions that will perpetuate its own nature. The adverb 'ajasram' — perpetually, without break — emphasises the self-reinforcing nature of this cycle: unlike merit-based rebirths that gradually exhaust karma, the āsurī cycle is self-perpetuating because its defining feature (rejection of Brahman) prevents the very śraddhā that could reverse it. Verse 20 will complete this picture."

        "dadaji": "Sri Krishna addresses Arjuna as 'Kaunteya' at this most solemn moment — 'O son of Kuntī.' This address carries a hidden message: Kunti was the embodiment of surrender and devotion. By addressing her son with her name at this juncture, Sri Krishna is subtly saying: 'Remember your inheritance — you are born of devotion, not of delusion. You are not these āsurī souls; you belong to the daivī sampat.' The phrase 'mām aprāpya eva' — without ever reaching Me — is the most tragic phrase in this passage. The final fall, 'adhamāṃ gatim,' is the outcome not of dramatic sin but of the steady habit of turning away from God.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse brings the āsurī portrait to its logical conclusion. 'Janmani janmani' — birth after birth — corresponds to what modern Vedantins describe as the samskaāra-laden causal body being carried through multiple lives, each impression deepening the groove of āsurī tendency. 'Mām aprāpya eva' is the most precise definition of saṃsāra: the state of existing without ever arriving at one's own deepest nature, the Ātman-Brahman. 'Adhamāṃ gatim' — the lowest state — is not merely a destination but a direction: the progressive contraction of consciousness away from its own infinite nature. This verse sets up the rescue operation of v21-24: the three gates of hell that the wise must abandon.",
        "yogananda": "Birth after birth, without once catching the fragrance of the Divine — this is the verse that most moved me when I first encountered it, because it shows the stakes of our spiritual choices. Yogananda taught that every human incarnation is an extraordinary opportunity, precisely because in the human form the soul has the capacity for self-reflection, devotion, and liberation. To waste it in the āsurī pattern — not once, but janmani janmani — is the deepest tragedy the Gita describes. Yet the very next section offers the key: identify and abandon the three gates of hell (kāma, krodha, lobha), follow the śāstric guidance, and the trajectory reverses toward the Divine.",
        "goyandka": "This verse is the culmination of the āsurī section (v6-20) and serves as the dark counterpart to the opening daivī portrait (v1-3). The phrase 'mām aprāpya eva' — without ever reaching Me — is the most theologically precise summary of the āsurī tragedy: it is not the accumulation of sin per se that constitutes damnation, but the structural incapacity, born of sustained āsurī living, to turn toward and receive the Lord. 'Adhamāṃ gatim' corresponds to what the dharmaśāstra describes as the lowest sub-human births. The transitional function of this verse is important: having completed the portrait of āsurī bondage, the Gita now turns, in the verses that follow, to prescribe the śāstric path as the means of escape — the direct antidote to the ajñāna-vimohitā condition described throughout this section."
