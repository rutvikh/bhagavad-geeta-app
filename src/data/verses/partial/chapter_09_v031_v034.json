        "dadaji": "Here the Lord makes His most personal promise — not as a philosophical statement but as a father's oath. He tells Arjuna, 'You declare it, you bear witness: My devotee never perishes.' The word pratijānīhi means 'you make this pledge' — as if Krishna entrusts Arjuna to carry this assurance to every heart that doubts. The devotee may stumble, may err gravely, but the Lord's hand does not release. Kṣipram — quickly — because divine grace does not wait for perfection. The moment sincere turning happens, the transformation begins. This verse has sustained countless souls through darkness: whenever I feel I have failed, I return here. Not God's devotee never stumbles — but God's devotee never ultimately falls. What a shelter these words are.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Verse 31 crowns the previous verse's promise with the Lord's personal guarantee. Pratijānīhi — 'make this known, declare it as truth' — is a remarkable usage; Krishna asks Arjuna to be the messenger of this assurance. From the Vedantic standpoint, the mechanics are clear: turning toward the Self, even imperfectly, initiates the purification of the antaḥkaraṇa. Kṣipram, quickly, indicates that the power of bhakti accelerates the dissolution of vāsanās far more efficiently than unaided effort. Dharmātmā — he becomes a righteous soul — not because he forces himself into virtue but because proximity to the divine naturally orders the personality. The ultimate statement, na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati, is the Gita's unconditional pledge: the orientation toward the infinite cannot result in loss.",
        "yogananda": "This verse vibrates with the certainty of divine law. The devotee who turns inward — even from the darkest state — quickly becomes dharmātmā, a soul aligned with cosmic righteousness. 'Quickly' is significant: in the inner life, one sincere act of turning toward God can dissolve karma accumulated over lifetimes, because the soul touches its own eternal nature. Śaśvat-śānti, everlasting peace, is not a future reward but the recognition of one's true nature — the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss of the Self. Then Krishna makes His solemn declaration: 'My devotee never perishes.' The devotee may lose a body, may wander through incarnations, but the current of divine love once awakened is inextinguishable. God's love is the only absolute guarantee in existence.",
        "goyandka": "The Lord concludes His discussion of the fallen devotee with a categorical assurance. The phrase pratijānīhi, addressed to Arjuna, means 'you proclaim this as My pledge' — transforming the listener into a witness and bearer of divine promise. The fallen devotee of the previous verse (9.30) who is resolved in his devotion quickly becomes dharmātmā because the influence of satsaṅga, scripture, and the Lord's grace purifies his mind with speed. Śaśvac-chāntim refers to the peace of liberation, which is permanent unlike the transient pleasures of svarga. The closing declaration, na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati, is the Gita's most unequivocal protection clause. It applies not merely to this life but across all existences — the soul oriented toward the Lord is never abandoned."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "How my heart opens every time I read this verse. Krishna demolishes every barrier that human society had constructed around the divine. Not just the learned brahmin, not just the king — but the merchant, the servant, and the woman, all equally embraced. The phrase pāpa-yonayaḥ in that era referred to those born outside privileged lineages, those whom society had labeled spiritually disqualified. The Lord overturns it all with one word: vyapāśritya — 'having taken refuge in Me.' That is the only qualification. No birth, no caste, no gender determines one's eligibility before God. The door to the supreme goal is open to every soul who genuinely turns toward Him. In this verse, Krishna is not merely tolerant — He is radically inclusive. This is the bhakti revolution.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse must be read in its historical and spiritual context together. Socially, Krishna is dismantling the hierarchy of spiritual eligibility prevalent in His time — the idea that only certain births confer the right to liberation. Philosophically, the verse makes an even deeper point: Brahman, the ultimate reality, cannot be restricted by any human category. The Ātman has no caste, no gender, no birth-quality. Therefore, vyapāśritya — taking complete refuge — is the sole criterion. Parā gati, the supreme destination, is Brahman itself, and it is equidistant from every soul regardless of social location. Śaṅkarācārya notes that the verse progresses from those of questionable birth to women to vaiśyas to śūdras — each considered in descending social privilege — yet all equally capable of the highest attainment through bhakti.",
        "yogananda": "Here Krishna reveals the universality of the spiritual path with extraordinary courage. In a society rigidly stratified by birth, He declares that even those branded by pāpa-yoni — inauspicious birth — can attain the parā gati, the supreme state of God-union. The key is vyapāśritya: taking complete, unreserved refuge. This is not casual acknowledgment of God but the total offering of one's being. Women, merchants, laborers — all who yearn for God with wholehearted devotion reach the same summit. Spiritually, this teaches that the soul's capacity for liberation is intrinsic, not granted by birth or social standing. Every soul is equally a spark of the Infinite. The path home is bhakti — the magnetic pull of the part toward the Whole.",
        "goyandka": "This verse establishes the universal accessibility of bhakti-mārga. The qualifier pāpa-yonayaḥ was understood in the Gita's cultural context as those born into circumstances that limited access to Vedic study and ritual. Krishna overrides all such distinctions with a single condition: māṃ vyapāśritya — taking refuge in Me completely. The word vyapāśritya is compound and intensive, meaning 'having fully surrendered to Me as one's sole support.' Striyo vaiśyāḥ śūdrāḥ are mentioned not to demean but to demonstrate the extent of the Lord's grace — if even those traditionally excluded from certain paths can attain parā gati through bhakti, how much more so anyone else (answered in the very next verse). The supreme goal here is mokṣa, liberation from the cycle of birth and death."

        "dadaji": "The logic flows beautifully: if even those in difficult circumstances can reach the supreme goal through devotion, then those already blessed with purity and wisdom — the brāhmaṇas, the rājarṣis — how naturally the path opens for them. But then Krishna pivots completely. He looks at this world we all inhabit — anitya, impermanent, and asukha, joyless — and issues a gentle but urgent call: 'Bhajasva mām — worship Me.' The emphasis on 'having obtained this human birth in this difficult world' is a reminder not to waste time. We have arrived somewhere rare and brief. The wise brahmin and the royal sage are mentioned not to pride themselves but to feel the greater responsibility. More light means more opportunity to illuminate the way for others — and to keep walking toward the Source.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The rhetorical device kiṃ punaḥ — 'what then to speak of' — completes an a fortiori argument begun in verse 32. If those with every social disadvantage attain liberation through bhakti, the brāhmaṇas and rājarṣis, already equipped with sattvic disposition, Vedic knowledge, and devotional inclination, have every advantage. Yet the real teaching arrives in the second half of the verse. Anityam asukham lokam imaṃ prāpya — 'having obtained this impermanent, joyless world.' This is not pessimism but viveka, discrimination. Saṃsāra is not condemned but accurately appraised. Every pleasure here is finite, every body is temporary. Having seen this clearly, the instruction follows naturally: bhajasva mām. Use this rare human birth to turn toward the Eternal.",
        "yogananda": "Krishna completes the ascending argument: if even souls in the most challenging circumstances reach God through devoted surrender, how much more readily can those already attuned to higher consciousness — the brāhmaṇa who contemplates Truth, the rājarṣi who has renounced power — find their way home. Then the Master delivers a profound reminder: you have entered a world that is anitya, impermanent, and asukha, without lasting joy. Every pleasure borrowed from this world must eventually be returned. But this awareness is not cause for despair — it is cause for direction. 'Having come here,' Krishna says, 'use this rare, difficult incarnation wisely: bhajasva mām, worship Me.' The guru within each soul echoes this in meditation: the world passes, only God remains.",
        "goyandka": "Verse 33 employs the logical inference kiṃ punaḥ — if the lesser case holds, the greater surely does. Having established that even those of pāpa-yoni attain parā gati through refuge in the Lord, Krishna notes that the brāhmaṇas already possessed of purity (puṇyāḥ) and the rājarṣis already given to devotion stand in an even more favorable position. The verse then transitions to an urgent practical exhortation. Anityam asukham describes human existence with precise Vedantic terminology: anitya because the body-world complex is subject to decay, asukham because no worldly object yields unmixed or lasting happiness. Imaṃ lokam prāpya — 'having obtained this world' — implies the rarity of human birth. The imperative bhajasva mām calls for continuous devotional worship as the only intelligent use of such an opportunity."

        "dadaji": "This is the verse I return to at the beginning and end of every day. Four imperatives — man-manā bhava, mad-bhakto bhava, mad-yājī, māṃ namaskuru — and the Lord states them simply, without condition, without elaborate ritual requirement. Fix the mind on Me. Be My devotee. Worship Me. Bow to Me. This is the whole of spiritual life distilled into four gestures. And the promise: mām evaiṣyasi — you will come to Me, certainly, inevitably. Not 'you might,' not 'if you deserve it.' The word eva — 'verily' — carries the full weight of divine certainty. Mat-parāyaṇaḥ says it all: make Me your supreme refuge, your final resting place. The chapter that began with 'I will declare the most secret knowledge' ends here — and the secret turns out to be love. Pure, simple, boundless love directed at the Lord. Nothing more is needed.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Verse 34 is the magnificent conclusion of the Raja Vidya chapter and one of the most luminous verses in the entire Gita. The four imperatives form a complete map of bhakti: man-manā bhava is the cognitive dimension — the mind continuously returning to the Lord; mad-bhakto is the emotional dimension — love and devotion; mad-yājī is the active dimension — offering all one's actions as worship; māṃ namaskuru is the dimension of humility — the ego bowing before the Infinite. Together they describe a total reorientation of the human being. The promise, mām evaiṣyasi, 'you will surely come to Me,' is framed by yuktvaivam ātmānam — 'having thus unified the self.' The word yukta here carries the full weight of yoga: the integrated, harmonized being who has made the Lord the center of every dimension of existence attains identity with that Lord. The secret wisdom of Chapter 9 culminates not in metaphysical doctrine but in love.",
        "yogananda": "In this closing verse the Master of Yoga reveals the entire science of divine union in four luminous phrases. Man-manā bhava: keep the mind anchored in God-consciousness — this is the practice of continuous inner recollection, what the Christian mystics called 'the practice of the Presence.' Mad-bhakto: let the heart's love flow uninterruptedly toward the Divine Beloved — this is the bhakti that purifies all lower desires. Mad-yājī: transform every action into a sacred offering — the yogi who eats, works, and breathes 'for God' lives in perpetual worship. Māṃ namaskuru: bow in profound humility — the dissolution of ego-pride that allows God to fully enter. Mat-parāyaṇaḥ, making God one's supreme goal, is the unifying principle. The result — mām evaiṣyasi — is not metaphorical but literal: the individual consciousness merges back into the Infinite Consciousness from which it emerged. This is the culminating secret of the Royal Chapter.",
        "goyandka": "This capstone verse, which also appears virtually verbatim in Chapter 18 verse 65, distills the entire teaching of the Gita's bhakti-yoga into four precise imperatives. (1) Man-manā bhava: fix the mind on the Lord, which is dhyāna, meditation. (2) Mad-bhakto bhava: cultivate exclusive devotion, which is the root of all other sādhanās. (3) Mad-yājī: perform all worship — ritualistic and internal — as an offering to the Lord, which is pūjā and karma-yoga combined. (4) Māṃ namaskuru: offer prostrations with genuine reverence, dissolving the ahaṃkāra. These four together constitute complete sādhana at the level of mind, heart, action, and ego. Yuktvaivam ātmānam — 'having disciplined the self in this manner' — indicates that this is a rigorous practice, not a casual sentiment. The result, mām evaiṣyasi, 'you will come to Me alone,' is the Lord's personal and unconditional assurance. Mat-parāyaṇaḥ, making God the sole refuge and supreme end, is the defining characteristic of the true bhakta. Chapter 9 thus concludes with the highest instruction: surrender everything — mind, devotion, worship, and ego — to the Lord."
