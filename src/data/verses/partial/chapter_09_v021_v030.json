      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "Krishna is gently showing Arjuna the poverty of bargaining with God. Those who perform Vedic rites with their eye on heaven — they do get heaven, dear child. But heaven too is a marketplace of merit; once the coins run out, down you come. Grandfather used to say: 'A gift given expecting a return is not a gift — it is a loan.' These souls keep bouncing between earth and sky like a ball, never at rest. The tragedy is not that they fall from heaven — it is that they never truly arrived. Real arrival is in God's own abode. Until we love God for God's sake alone, not for what He can give, we will keep traveling this exhausting road of gatāgatam — coming and going, coming and going.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse completes a crucial Vedantic argument. The Vedas, understood at their surface level, promise svarga — heavenly enjoyment — as the fruit of ritual. But notice what the Lord says: svarga is viśāla, vast, yet it is still bounded. Any finite result produced by a finite action must be finite. This is the fundamental law: kṣīṇe puṇye, when the merit runs out, the effect also runs out. The Upanishads make this the very rationale for seeking liberation — Brahman alone is infinite, and therefore Brahman alone can give infinite, unending joy. The trayī-dharma is not condemned here; it is simply seen as incomplete. Those who go no further than Vedic ritual attain only gatāgatam — the revolving door of samsāra.",
        "yogananda": "Heaven is a state of consciousness, not merely a location. Those who perform good actions motivated by desire for reward are, in reality, projecting their own mental state outward. They rise to refined astral planes corresponding to their accumulated virtue — but those planes are still within the dream of duality. When the energy of their good karma is spent, like a dreamer who stirs as the pleasant dream fades, they descend again. The teaching here is profound: even heavenly experience is a distraction from the ultimate goal of God-union. True yoga is not the exchange of merit for pleasure — it is the dissolution of the separate self back into the Infinite Source, after which there is no more coming and going.",
        "goyandka": "The Lord here concludes His exposition of the Vedic ritualists who seek svarga through sacrifice. He establishes an inviolable principle: any fruit born of action is proportionate to the action and is therefore perishable. Svarga is listed among the fourteen worlds in the Purāṇas — a realm of refined pleasure — yet it remains within the three guṇas and is subject to time. The phrase kāma-kāmāḥ is significant: they are defined entirely by their desires. Until desire itself is offered to the Lord, the soul has no resting place. The Gītā, viewed as a whole, moves from this picture of perpetual transmigration toward the supreme teaching of śaraṇāgati — total surrender — which alone ends the cycle."

        "dadaji": "This is God's own promise, and He keeps every promise. Yoga-kṣemam vahāmy aham — 'I carry their burden.' Can you imagine? The Lord of all creation saying: I will personally take care of you. Not through intermediaries, not through impersonal laws, but personally — vahāmi, I carry. The condition is ananyāḥ — no other, only Me. This is not an exclusion of the world but a transformation of our relationship to it. When we see God in everything, when our heart turns to Him in joy and sorrow alike, then He steps in as provider and protector. I have seen this in my own life, and in the lives of those who gave themselves wholly to Him. Surrender everything, and find that everything is taken care of.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is often cited as the most direct statement of divine grace in the Gītā. The word ananyāḥ — those who have no other — points to what the Upanishads call ekāgratā, one-pointed concentration on Brahman. The term yoga-kṣema is borrowed from worldly usage: yoga is obtaining what one does not have, kṣema is securing what one has. The Lord turns this very worldly anxiety upside down — He says, do not worry about either; I handle both. The key word is vahāmi — I carry, I bear. This is not metaphor; it is the Vedantic truth that Ātman, the Self, is always the true provider of all that appears in experience. Recognising this, the devotee rests in complete ease.",
        "yogananda": "The Lord describes here the most intimate relationship possible between the soul and God. Ananyāḥ — those who are non-separate — have achieved, at least in aspiration, the union that is the goal of all yoga. Their cintana, their continuous thought of God, is not effort but love. And God responds to love with love. Yoga-kṣema: He provides what is needed and preserves what is given. On the inner plane this means: the new spiritual attainments that come through meditation are His gift (yoga), and He ensures they are not lost through worldly distractions (kṣema). This is the inner science of devotion — a living exchange of love between the devotee and the Infinite.",
        "goyandka": "The śāstras divide seekers into those motivated by desire (sakāma) and those desiring only God (niṣkāma, or here ananya). This verse explicitly addresses the second class. The Lord's promise is unconditional for the ananya-bhakta: He Himself takes on the responsibility of yoga and kṣema. The commentator Śaṅkarācārya notes that this verse is not a license for indolence — the devotee must still perform prescribed duties — but it is an assurance that the fruits of all righteous effort are borne by the Lord. The word vahāmi, in the present tense, indicates this is not a future reward but an ongoing, continuous act of divine care. This is the supreme consolation of bhakti."

        "dadaji": "God's heart is bigger than all our theologies. He says: even those who pray to other gods — they are praying to Me, they just do not know it yet. A child calls out 'Mama!' in the dark, and no matter who is nearby, it is the mother who runs. Sincere prayer always reaches the One. The word avidhi-pūrvakam — without the right method — is not a condemnation; it is a gentle observation. They will get the fruits corresponding to the deity they worship, which are limited compared to the boundless grace of the Supreme. But their faith is real, their love is real, and God receives it. Eventually, through grace, they will come to know the whole truth. No sincere prayer is ever wasted.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This is one of the great Vedantic declarations of the unity of all worship. The Ṛg Veda itself says: 'ekaṃ sad viprā bahudhā vadanti' — Truth is one, the wise call it by many names. Krishna here gives the philosophical basis: all deities are manifestations of the one Brahman. Therefore all worship, regardless of the form of the deity, ultimately reaches Brahman. The qualification avidhi-pūrvakam does not negate the worship; it points to its limitation. Worshipping a particular form yields the fruit of that form — finite and bounded. Worshipping the formless Supreme yields the infinite. The direction is right; only the destination needs clarification.",
        "yogananda": "God is the one ocean; the gods and goddesses are waves. When a devotee prays to any wave with true feeling, the vibration enters the ocean. This is the metaphysical truth Krishna is stating. However, there is a vital distinction: waves do not encompass the ocean, and so the fruits received through lesser deities are correspondingly limited. The mystic understands that all personal forms of the divine — whether Shiva, Durga, or any other — are doorways to the one Infinite Consciousness. The sincere devotee who prays to any form is already on the path. What the Lord gently points toward is a deeper, more direct love that sees through the form to the formless ocean itself.",
        "goyandka": "The Lord here establishes a philosophical principle of great import: all deities are rays of the one supreme Brahman. Therefore worship directed toward any deity does ultimately reach the Lord, but the mechanism is indirect and hence called avidhi-pūrvakam — not according to the correct injunction. The correct injunction (vidhi) is to worship the Supreme directly as the ultimate recipient of all sacrifice, as stated in verse 24. The fruit of worshipping other gods is accordingly limited to those gods' powers of bestowal. The Gītā does not disparage such worship but reveals its limitation, in order to encourage the seeker to aspire to the highest. This verse read with the next forms a complete teaching on the hierarchy of worship."

        "dadaji": "Every lamp lit in any temple, every prayer murmured in any tongue — God is the one who receives it. He is the bhoktā, the enjoyer, and the prabhu, the master of all sacrifice. When a grandmother offers a simple flame to her family deity, God accepts it; how could He not? But not knowing this truth — not knowing that the One who receives is none other than the Supreme — means the giver is still dealing with a middleman they invented. And so they fall, cyavanti, slipping back from the benefit they might have received. The remedy is simple: know who you are really offering to. Even in your ordinary prayer today, know: He is there, He receives, He loves. That knowing changes everything.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The word tattva is crucial — it literally means 'thatness,' the essential being of a thing. To know God tattvena is to know Him as He truly is: the one Consciousness that underlies all names and forms, the singular Bhoktā behind every experience of every being. The word cyavanti — they fall — echoes the Muṇḍaka Upanishad's statement about those who regard sacrifices as the highest: 'kṣīṇe loke cyavante' — they fall when their merit is spent. The pattern is the same: any action directed toward a finite goal produces a finite result and thus ends in decline. Only the knowledge of the Infinite, offered to the Infinite, dissolves the very mechanism of falling.",
        "yogananda": "God is the cosmic Receiver of all energy offered in love or devotion, regardless of the form through which it is offered. The sacrificial fire is a symbol: all energy in the universe returns to its source, the Divine. The tragedy Krishna points to is not impiety but ignorance — not knowing tattvena, not realising that the Cosmic Consciousness is the sole experiencer behind all experience. Those who perform ritual without this realisation gain merit proportional to their effort but remain within the field of cause and effect. The yogi seeks to offer not just ritual but the very sense of individual selfhood into the fire of divine love, knowing that the Self is itself the sacrifice, the priest, and the Lord.",
        "goyandka": "This verse provides the theological foundation for the claim in verse 23 that all worship reaches the Lord. He is sarva-yajñānāṃ bhoktā — the sole recipient of all sacrifice — and prabhu — the sovereign lord who apportions results. The devatās who appear to receive worship are in fact agents of the Lord, distributing His grace according to the form of worship directed to them. The failure of the worshippers lies not in devotion but in tattva-jñāna — knowledge of the ultimate reality. Without this knowledge they remain within the domain of the three guṇas and eventually fall. The teaching prepares the ground for the next verse's radical disclosure of the equal accessibility of the Lord to all."

        "sarvapriyananda": "The Vedanta recognises multiple planes of existence corresponding to different states of consciousness and degrees of spiritual refinement. This verse maps the correspondence between the object of worship and the destination attained. The principle is the law of likeness: the mind shaped by devotion to a particular reality gradually becomes like that reality and gravitates toward it at the time of death. The devas represent refined cosmic intelligences; the pitṛs represent the realm of past human generations; the bhūtas represent sub-personal elemental forces. The Lord's abode — attained by mad-yājinaḥ — is Brahman itself, beyond all these planes. The śāstra calls it akṣara — imperishable — precisely because it transcends the cycle.",

Ancestors, gods, nature spirits — these are real planes of astral existence, subtle realms of energy and consciousness. But they are all within māyā, within the dream of separation. The devotees of the Supreme Lord — those who in meditation and love have contacted the Infinite — pass beyond all these relative planes at death and merge into the Infinite Itself. 'My worshippers come to Me.' This is the whole promise of the spiritual life.",

This verse lists four in ascending order: devalokas (heavenly realms), pitṛlokas (ancestral realms), bhūtalokas (realms of subtle beings), and finally the supreme abode of the Lord. The key teaching is the principle that the fruit is commensurate with the object of worship. Worship of the limited yields limited results; worship of the unlimited yields the unlimited. The Gītā consistently uses this contrast to guide the sincere seeker away from the transient toward the eternal. The phrase mad-yājinaḥ — My sacrificers — encompasses the full range of bhakti: ritual, meditative, and jñāna-mixed devotion."

        "dadaji": "This is my favourite verse in the whole Gītā. Not gold, not grand temples, not hours of elaborate ritual — a leaf, a flower, a fruit, a cup of water. That is all He asks. And He says aśnāmi — I eat it, I actually receive it and delight in it — when it is given bhaktyā, with love. The condition is prayatātmanaḥ, a pure heart. Not a perfect life, not great scholarship, not high birth — a pure, loving heart. Any child in any village can offer a tulasī leaf with love. Any old woman can offer a cup of water with tears of longing. And God, the master of the universe, happily eats it. If this verse does not melt your heart, read it again. This is why we love Him.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The Vedantic profundity of this verse lies in what it says about the nature of God. He is pūrṇa — complete, needing nothing. Yet He says aśnāmi — I eat, I receive. Why would the infinite need a leaf or a flower? The answer is that this verse is not about God's needs but about the devotee's transformation. The act of conscious, loving offering is what purifies the mind. Prayatātmanaḥ — pure of heart — is both the condition and the fruit. God accepts the offering not because He requires it but because the act of offering in love transforms the giver. This is the secret of karma-yoga applied to bhakti: the offering matters infinitely, not as an object, but as the vehicle of love.",
        "yogananda": "When a devotee offers a flower to God with genuine love, that flower becomes charged with spiritual vibration — it is no longer merely a botanical object but a carrier of consciousness. Aśnāmi — I receive this — means the cosmic Consciousness absorbs that vibration of love back into Itself, completing a circuit of divine communion. The four items listed — leaf, flower, fruit, water — represent the four natural kingdoms and suggest that all of nature can become an altar. Every moment of pure appreciation of nature, every heartfelt gratitude for rain or fruit, is already an unconscious form of this offering. The yogi makes it conscious. Prayatātmanaḥ is the key: the purity that allows the circuit of love to complete.",
        "goyandka": "The greatness of this verse lies in its accessibility. The Lord removes every economic or social barrier to worship. Patraṃ, puṣpaṃ, phalaṃ, toyam — the most common, freely available items of nature — are declared sufficient for the highest form of worship when offered with bhakti. The commentators note that the tulasī leaf stands supreme among patrā in Vaiṣṇava tradition, and that pure Gaṅgā water represents toyam. But the essential teaching transcends these specifics: it is the quality of the offering (bhakty-upahṛtam) and the quality of the offerer (prayatātmanaḥ) that matter, not the monetary value. This verse is the basis for the Vaiṣṇava pañcopacāra pūjā and indeed all forms of simple daily worship."

        "dadaji": "Here Krishna gives the most practical instruction in the whole of the Gītā. He does not say: leave your family, go to a forest, perform elaborate rites. He says: do whatever you are already doing — eating, working, giving, praying — but turn it toward Me. Mad-arpaṇam — dedicate it all to Me. The word arpaṇam means to place something in someone's hands. Imagine placing every single action of your day — every bite of food, every hour of work, every coin given in charity — gently in His hands. That is the practice. It costs nothing extra except a change of intention. And that change of intention is everything. This is how an ordinary household life becomes a continuous act of worship.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is the essence of karma-yoga and bhakti-yoga unified. The Gītā has in earlier chapters taught action without attachment to results. Here the positive form of the same instruction is given: offer every action to the Lord. The psychological mechanism is profound — when an action is dedicated to the Lord, the doer disidentifies from the outcome. 'I am not the doer; I am offering this to Him.' This is the practical means of achieving the naiṣkarmya-siddhi — the perfection of actionlessness — within action itself. Mad-arpaṇam transforms the entire field of daily life into a continuous meditation. The yat...yat...yat structure is deliberate: nothing is excluded, not even eating.",
        "yogananda": "This verse describes what I have called the practice of constant communion. Every act, consecrated to God, becomes an act of yoga. The Bhagavad Gītā here presents a complete path for the householder and the renunciant alike: not withdrawal from activity but transformation of its inner quality. When you eat with the consciousness that God is the one eating through you, food becomes prasāda. When you work with the awareness that God's energy is working through your hands, labour becomes pūjā. This is not a metaphor — it is a description of a real inner state achievable through sustained spiritual practice. Mad-arpaṇam is the seed; constant rememberance is the water; divine union is the fruit.",
        "goyandka": "The structure of this verse is deliberate and comprehensive. Five domains of human activity are listed: general action (karoṣi), eating (aśnāsi), ritual sacrifice (juhoṣi), charity (dadāsi), and austerity (tapasyasi). Together these cover the entire range of a person's life — personal, social, religious, and ascetic. The Lord asks that all of it be converted into mad-arpaṇam — an offering to Him. This is the Gītā's solution to the problem of karma and bondage: not the cessation of action but its consecration. The result of this practice is given in the next verse — freedom from the bondage of good and evil fruits alike. Śrī Rāmānuja calls this sarva-karma-samarpaṇa and considers it the highest form of bhakti accessible to all."

Notice He says both śubha and aśubha — good fruits and bad fruits both bind. A gold chain and an iron chain are both chains. The good deeds we did, the merit we accumulated — all of it creates attachment, expectation, a ledger of give and take. When we offer everything to God, we step outside the ledger entirely. Sannyāsa-yoga-yuktātmā — your inner self yoked to renunciation — does not mean abandoning life. It means holding nothing back from God. And then: vimukto mām upaiṣyasi — liberated, you will come to Me. That is the whole point, dear child. That is the whole journey.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse gives the fruit of the practice prescribed in verse 27. Śubhāśubha-phalaiḥ karma-bandhanaiḥ — from the bonds constituted by the fruits of both good and evil actions. This is a precise statement of the theory of karma in Vedanta: every action, including meritorious action, creates a saṃskāra, a residue, that must eventually be experienced. Liberation requires the cessation of both pāpa and puṇya as binding forces. The path of mad-arpaṇam achieves this because an action fully surrendered to Brahman creates no saṃskāra for the surrenderer — it is as if it were never done by the individual self. Sannyāsa-yoga here is not formal monasticism but the inner renunciation of doership.",
        "yogananda": "The twin fruits of good and evil karma are like a pendulum — the further it swings one way, the further it must swing back. Only by stopping the motion entirely — by withdrawing the energy of ego-identification from all action — does the pendulum come to rest. This is what sannyāsa-yoga means esoterically: the inner renunciation of the sense that 'I' am the actor. When every action is offered to God, the 'I' that accumulates karma gradually dissolves. Vimukto — liberated — describes the state in which the individual stream of consciousness merges back into the Ocean from which it arose. Upaiṣyasi — you will come to Me — is the assurance that this union is not merely possible but guaranteed for the sincere practitioner.",
        "goyandka": "This verse presents the logical conclusion of the karma-yoga and bhakti-yoga synthesis that has been built across the preceding verses. The term sannyāsa-yoga-yuktātmā deserves careful attention. Śaṅkarācārya interprets sannyāsa here as the renunciation of the sense of doership and enjoyership — not necessarily external monastic renunciation. Rāmānuja sees it as the yoga of complete dedication to the Lord. Both interpretations converge on the same practical reality: the ego's claim on its actions must be released. When this release is complete, karma — which is nothing other than the ego's web of cause and effect — has nothing to grip. The soul, thus unentangled, attains the Lord."

Yet the second half seems to introduce difference: devotees are in Me, and I in them. The resolution is that the second half speaks from the relative plane of bhakti, while the first speaks from the absolute plane of jñāna. At the level of manifestation, the receptivity created by bhakti allows a greater flow of grace. Both statements are true at their respective levels.",

Mayi te teṣu cāpy aham — they in Me, and I in them. This mutual indwelling is the description of samādhi — the union in which the distinction between devotee and God dissolves. The great saints did not find God as an external being who specially favoured them; they found that what they had always been — consciousness itself — is God. The love of bhakti is the melting of the wave back into the ocean.",
        "goyandka": "This verse answers a potential objection: if the Lord is impartial, why do His devotees prosper spiritually while others do not? The answer is in the structure of the verse itself. The Lord's impartiality (samatā) is absolute — no being is inherently more loved or hated. But the principle of bhajana — worshipping, turning toward — creates a special reciprocal relationship. Mayi te teṣu cāpy aham describes a profound interpenetration: the devotee's consciousness merges into the Lord, and the Lord's presence fills the devotee. This is the technical description of what the bhakti-śāstras call āveśa — divine entry — and what the Vedānta calls jīvan-mukti. The impartiality ensures justice; the responsiveness to bhakti ensures grace."

The decision to worship the Lord — ananya-bhāk, with undivided devotion — is the assertion of the higher Self over the lower self. Samyag vyavasito — rightly resolved — is the key phrase. The resolution to turn toward Brahman is itself an act of the highest wisdom, regardless of the past conduct of the personality.

In the Gītā's language, every soul is a ray of divine consciousness temporarily identified with a particular stream of karma. However dark that stream, the ray itself is untouched. When the soul, however burdened with past karma, makes the fundamental turn toward God — ananya-bhāk, with no other support — a divine alchemy begins. The accumulated samskaras do not vanish overnight, but they no longer accumulate. The ship changes course. Samyag vyavasito — rightly resolved — describes a shift at the deepest level of the will. Krishna's declaration that such a soul is sādhu is His assurance that divine grace is stronger than any karmic accumulation.",

Su-durācāra refers to one whose external conduct has been extremely sinful — a person perhaps driven by intense past samskaras, not by deliberate wickedness. Ananya-bhāk means his devotion is exclusive and undivided: he has surrendered completely to the Lord with no reservation. The Lord declares such a person sādhu — one heading straight toward the goal. The reasoning is: samyag vyavasito hi saḥ — he has rightly determined. The determination (vyavasāya) to take sole refuge in God is itself the supreme dharma. The Bhāgavata Purāṇa echoes this teaching: 'Even the worst sinner crosses over sin by the boat of bhakti.' This verse must be read with the next, verse 31, which provides the assurance of the outcome."
