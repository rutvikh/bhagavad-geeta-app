      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "Beloved child, with what tenderness the Lord opens this great teaching! He begins with abhayam — fearlessness — because until the heart is free from fear, no divine quality can truly bloom. These nine jewels of the first verse are not commandments but gifts already latent within you, waiting to be uncovered. Sattva-saṃśuddhi is the daily washing of the heart in the Ganga of devotion, and jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti means planting your feet so firmly in the Lord's truth that no wind of worldly opinion can move you. Offer your dāna, observe your dama, perform your yajña — and in this very offering, O dear one, the soul discovers it has always been free.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Vedanta teaches that our true nature is sat-cit-ānanda — pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss — and the divine qualities listed here are simply the natural expression of that nature when the veil of avidyā grows thin. Abhayam arises spontaneously when one recognizes that there is nothing apart from the Self to threaten it. Sattva-saṃśuddhi is the purification of the antaḥkaraṇa (inner instrument) that makes it a transparent mirror for Brahman. Jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti is not acquisition of new knowledge but steady abidance in the knowledge 'aham brahmāsmi.' These qualities are the indicators of progress on the Vedantic path — not goals to be achieved by effort alone, but fruits that ripen naturally when the ego loosens its grip.",
        "yogananda": "The divine qualities are the outward signatures of the soul gradually reclaiming its birthright. Fearlessness is not mere courage — it is the direct metaphysical recognition that the soul, being of the nature of God, can never be truly harmed or destroyed. Sattva-saṃśuddhi corresponds to the raising of life-force from the lower chakras toward the spiritual centers — the purification is quite literally an energetic one. Jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti is the state of samādhi made stable and practical, carried into daily life. When dāna, dama, yajña, svādhyāya, tapa, and ārjava all flow from that inner stillness, each act of giving, each act of restraint, each study and each austerity becomes a form of communion with the Infinite.",
        "goyandka": "The first verse opens Bhagavān's grand enumeration of the daivī sampat — the divine endowments — that characterize one born to liberation. Abhayam stands first because fear is the primal disturbance of the inner life; its removal signals that the aspirant has taken genuine refuge in the Supreme. Sattva-saṃśuddhi refers to the purification of the buddhi (intellect) and citta (mind-stuff) so that they reflect dharma accurately. Jñāna-yoga-vyavasthiti denotes steady, unwavering commitment to the path of discrimination (viveka) and dispassion (vairāgya). The remaining six — dāna, dama, yajña, svādhyāya, tapa, ārjava — form the outer ethical structure within which inner purification can safely proceed, each one counteracting a specific tendency toward adharma."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "See how the Lord's list keeps deepening — from fearlessness and purity He moves to ahiṃsā, the great vow of love, and then to satya, which is the Lord Himself speaking through us when we tell the truth. Akrodha is not suppression of anger but its genuine dissolution in the understanding that all are the Lord's own forms. Tyāga here is not the giving up of the world but the giving up of the cramped sense of 'mine,' so that everything flows freely from the hand of God through us. Dayā bhūteṣu — compassion to all beings — is the most beautiful of all, dear one, for when you see the Lord in every face, how can the heart not melt? And acāpala reminds us that steadiness is itself a form of devotion: the lamp that does not flicker illumines the shrine.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This second verse of the daivī sampat moves from outer ethical virtues to increasingly subtle inner ones. Ahiṃsā and satya are the twin pillars of Vedantic ethics — non-harm and non-falsehood — because violence and deception both arise from the fundamental error of seeing others as separate. Akrodha reflects the understanding that what we call an 'enemy' is simply another form of the one Self behaving under its own constraints of karma and conditioning. Apaiśuna — the absence of backbiting — is particularly important in Vedantic teaching because speech is a primary vehicle through which avidyā perpetuates itself; gossip and slander thicken the veil. Aloluptva (non-greed) and acāpala (steadiness) together describe the quality of a mind that has begun to rest in its own fullness rather than seeking completion outside itself.",
        "yogananda": "Each quality in this verse corresponds to a specific purification of the astral body. Ahiṃsā purifies the emotional center and gradually dissolves the defensive ego-contractions that generate fear and aggression. Satya aligns the throat center and the will with divine reality, making the individual an instrument of cosmic truth rather than personal convenience. Akrodha is the cooling of the fire-principle when it is used for rajasic rather than sattvic purposes — transmuting reactive anger into constructive will. Dayā bhūteṣu awakens the heart center, the anāhata, to its natural resonance with all life. Hrī — noble shame — is a spiritual sentinel: the soul's own wisdom that recoils from actions incompatible with its divine nature, a subtler and more reliable guide than any external rule.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Bhagavān continues the enumeration of daivī guṇas. Ahiṃsā is placed alongside satya because together they form the moral bedrock: the first protects beings from harm, the second aligns conduct with dharmic reality. Akrodha does not mean passivity but the mastery of the krodha-vṛtti (anger-modification) in the mind — an inner conquest more difficult and more valuable than any outer victory. Tyāga here means the abandonment of desire for results (phala-tyāga) rather than abandonment of activity itself, consistent with the karma-yoga teaching throughout the Gita. Apaiśuna — freedom from slander — protects the social fabric that makes dharmic life possible, while hrī (modesty/noble shame) is the internal governor that operates when no external enforcement exists. The verse closes with acāpala — unwavering steadiness — which Śaṅkarācārya glosses as freedom from purposeless agitation of the limbs and organs."

        "dadaji": "And here the Lord closes His magnificent garland of twenty-six divine qualities with six final jewels. Teja — spiritual radiance — is what happens when all the other qualities are lived: the soul begins to glow, not with personal pride but with the light of Brahman shining through a purified vessel. Kṣamā is the hardest and perhaps the greatest of them all, for it asks us to see even the one who wounds us as the Lord in disguise, working out the great drama of karma. Dhṛti is the quality that carries us through the dark nights of the soul — when devotion feels dry and the Lord seems far — and it is itself a form of the deepest love. O Bhārata, you are 'abhijāta' — born to this divine wealth! The Lord is not describing someone else; He is describing you, speaking your deepest name.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The closing verse of the daivī sampat list seals the teaching with great precision. Teja here is not ego-assertion but the natural luminosity of a buddhi thoroughly purified — the light of sattva in its highest expression, sometimes called ojas in Vedantic parlance. Kṣamā (forgiveness) is philosophically grounded in the non-dual recognition that the one who wronged you is also the Self — how can the Self hold a grudge against itself? Śauca bridges the outer and inner dimensions of practice: bodily purity prepares the ground for mental purity, and mental purity is what makes the mirror of the antaḥkaraṇa capable of reflecting Brahman without distortion. The verse closes with the liberating declaration: these twenty-six qualities belong to 'abhijātasya' — one whose very birth-nature tends toward the divine. They are not imposed from outside but recognized as one's own deepest constitution.",
        "yogananda": "Teja — spiritual radiance — is the visible sign of prāṇic abundance: when the life-force is no longer squandered in useless thoughts, sensory excess, or emotional turmoil, it accumulates as an aura of light and power that others feel in the saint's presence. Kṣamā requires the dissolution of the ego's memory function in its retaliatory mode — the saint forgives not because they lack feeling but because they perceive the deeper spiritual law operating through every situation. Dhṛti corresponds to the will faculty anchored in the spiritual eye, the ājñā center, which does not waver because it is rooted in superconscious clarity rather than the fluctuating emotions of the heart. The Lord's final word to Arjuna — 'abhijātasya bhārata,' born to the divine endowment — is a cosmic reassurance: your origin is divine, your destiny is liberation, and these qualities are not foreign virtues to be acquired but memories to be recovered.",
        "goyandka": "This verse concludes the three-verse enumeration of the twenty-six daivī guṇas with a formal declaration. Teja is the spiritual luster (brahma-teja) that accumulates through tapas, brahmacarya, and jñāna — it is distinct from mere physical vitality. Kṣamā is the quality most difficult to practice when provoked, and its placement near the end of the list suggests it is among the most mature fruits of inner development. Nātimānitā — 'not overly proud' — is carefully phrased: not 'no pride at all' but 'no excessive pride.' The qualified person has appropriate self-respect (ātma-gaurava) without the distorting inflation of ahaṅkāra. The closing declaration — 'bhavanti sampadaṃ daivīm abhijātasya bhārata' — formally defines this entire set as 'daivī sampat' (divine wealth), establishing the theological framework for the chapter: these qualities belong to the constitution of the liberated soul."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "How tersely and precisely the Lord describes the āsurī nature — just six qualities where the daivī list needed twenty-six! This tells us something beautiful: virtue is infinitely varied in its expressions, but ego has only a few faces, even if it wears a thousand masks. Dambha is perhaps the most insidious — it is the spiritual ego, the one who performs goodness for applause. Darpa and abhimāna together create the fortress of the 'I' that shuts out the Lord's grace. And ajñāna — ignorance — stands last and deepest, because it is the soil in which all the others grow. Dear child, when you see these qualities arising in yourself, do not despair — simply call out to the Lord, for even the recognition of āsurī tendencies is a spark of the divine discernment that the Lord is teaching Arjuna here.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The economy of this verse is striking — three verses for the daivī, one compact verse for the āsurī. Vedanta understands this: dharma (right conduct aligned with Ṛta, cosmic order) is multidimensional and expressive, while adharma collapses back to a few root distortions. Dambha is the ego performing virtue — the most dangerous form of avidyā because it uses the vocabulary of the spiritual while serving the self. Darpa and abhimāna are expressions of the ahaṅkāra (ego-principle) fully identified with the body-mind and its social position. Krodha and pāruṣya are its reactive defenses when that identification is threatened. Ajñāna — placed last — is identified by Śaṅkara as the taproot of all: it is the primal confusion of the apparent self (jīva) for the absolute Self (Brahman) that generates the entire āsurī structure.",
        "yogananda": "The six demoniac qualities form a tight inner causal chain. Ajñāna — ignorance — is the seed. From ignorance springs false identification with the ego, which naturally generates abhimāna (conceit). Abhimāna seeks external validation and status, producing darpa (arrogance). When that status is threatened, krodha (anger) arises as the ego's immune response. Krodha expresses as pāruṣya (cruelty and harshness) in relationship. And the entire structure is maintained and projected socially through dambha (pretense and showing-off). Sri Ramakrishna used to say that the ego is the last veil before God — these six qualities are that veil in its most dense form. The Lord's teaching is not condemnation but a diagnostic map, so the seeker can recognize and dissolve these patterns through discrimination, devotion, and surrender.",
        "goyandka": "Whereas the daivī qualities required twenty-six items across three verses to enumerate fully, the āsurī sampat is captured in six items in a single verse. Śrī Bhagavān presents them as a list parallel to the preceding: 'abhijātasya sampadam āsurīm' mirrors 'abhijātasya sampadaṃ daivīm' of v3. Dambha is pretentious show of religiosity without genuine inner quality — the Gita repeatedly identifies it as a great spiritual danger. Darpa is vanity based on learning, birth, or wealth. Abhimāna is self-conceit, the hardened ahaṅkāra. Krodha and pāruṣya are its outward expression in relationship. Ajñāna stands as the last and deepest term — pointing to the ultimate cause: the soul that does not know itself engages in all the rest. The commentarial tradition (Rāmānuja, Madhva, Śaṅkara) agrees that these six are listed as direct opposites of the leading qualities of the daivī list."

        "dadaji": "Here the Lord pauses His great teaching to reach out and touch Arjuna's heart directly — 'mā śucaḥ, do not grieve.' This is the very same phrase He used at the beginning of Chapter 2 when Arjuna was overwhelmed by sorrow. The Gita is, from beginning to end, an act of divine consolation. 'You are born to divine endowment, O Pāṇḍava' — not 'you may become' or 'you should strive to be,' but 'you ARE.' This is the Lord's deepest gift: the recognition that our essential nature is already divine. Daivī sampat leads to vimokṣa — liberation — and beloved child, if you have been drawn to study these words, to sit with this teaching, to love this Gita, know that the Lord is already calling you home. The journey is already underway.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is the practical heart of the chapter's opening section. The Vedantic declaration is precise: daivī sampat leads to vimokṣa (liberation) not because it earns liberation as a reward, but because it progressively removes the obstacles — the layers of avidyā, ahaṅkāra, and vāsanā — that prevent the recognition of what one already is. Āsurī sampat leads to nibandha (bondage) because it thickens these very veils. The Lord's personal assurance — 'abhijāto 'si pāṇḍava' — has deep Vedantic resonance: it is an anugraha-vākya (a liberating statement of grace), pointing directly at Arjuna's true nature. The wise teacher does not only teach doctrine; at the right moment, the teacher must say directly to the student: 'You are That. Do not doubt it.'",
        "yogananda": "This is one of the most personally intimate verses of the entire Gita. After listing twenty-six divine qualities and six demoniac ones, the Lord does not say 'now choose' — He says 'you have already been given the divine treasure; do not grieve.' The word 'abhijāta' — born with this nature — points to the soul's pre-natal spiritual constitution, what we might call karma accumulated across lifetimes of sadhana. Arjuna's very grief at Kurukshetra — his ahiṃsā, his kṣamā, his compassion for the fallen — are themselves evidence of his daivī nature, even though in that moment they appear as weakness. Vimokṣa is not a destination to be reached but a recognition to be fully embraced: the divine wealth is already yours. The Lord's 'mā śucaḥ' is an invitation to stop mourning a poverty that was never real.",
        "goyandka": "Verse 5 draws the theological and ethical conclusion of the chapter's opening movement. 'Daivī sampad vimokṣāya' — the divine endowment produces mukti, liberation from the bondage of karma and rebirth. 'Āsurī matā nibandhāya' — the demoniac endowment is considered (matā) to produce bondage; the word 'matā' (considered, held to be) is significant — it is the śāstric/traditional understanding, not just one opinion. The verse then pivots to direct personal address: 'mā śucaḥ' — do not grieve — addressing Arjuna's despondency directly. 'Abhijāto 'si pāṇḍava' echoes the use of 'abhijātasya' in v3 and v4 but now in second person singular, making it an immediate affirmation. Arjuna is not merely instructed; he is assured of his own divine constitution — a pastoral dimension of the Lord's teaching that the ācāryas have always treasured."

        "dadaji": "The Lord pauses to draw a clear map before descending into the depths of the āsurī description. 'There are two kinds of beings in this world' — not to condemn or exclude, but to help us see clearly where we are standing and where we are headed. The divine has been described 'vistaraśaḥ' — at length, in loving detail — because the Lord delights in dwelling upon the soul's possibilities. Now He asks Arjuna to listen carefully — 'me śṛṇu' — with full attention. There is great love in this preparation, dear one: before taking a student into difficult territory, the compassionate teacher says 'Now listen; I am going to show you something important.' The Lord's voice is always the voice of grace, even when the teaching grows sobering.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This structural verse marks the formal transition in the chapter's logic. The Vedantic significance is considerable: the division into daiva and āsura is not a division into two groups of people but a map of two tendencies within consciousness itself. Every human being carries both vectors — the movement toward liberation (mokṣa-pravṛtti) and the movement toward bondage (saṃsāra-pravṛtti). The chapter asks each seeker to honestly identify which tendency currently dominates. 'Daivo vistaraśaḥ proktaḥ' — the divine has been lavishly described — because the Vedantic tradition always begins with the positive, with what is to be cultivated. The demoniac is now to be described so that it can be recognized, not so that it can be judged in others, but so that it can be uprooted within.",
        "yogananda": "The clear binary of this verse — daiva and āsura — reflects a perennial yogic understanding of the two fundamental directions of the human will. In yogic terms, the daiva nature is the upward movement of the prāṇa and consciousness — evolution toward higher awareness, cosmic consciousness, liberation. The āsurī nature is the downward pull — devolution toward material identification, sense-slavery, and the contraction of awareness into the ego-shell. Both are real forces in every human being, and the teaching of Chapter 16 is essentially a training in self-diagnosis: which force is guiding my choices, my speech, my relationships? The Lord's command 'me śṛṇu' — listen to Me — is itself a remedy: the moment consciousness turns toward the divine, the āsurī current weakens.",
        "goyandka": "This verse has the character of a sūtra — a thread-sutra holding together what preceded and what follows. The phrase 'dvau bhūta-sargau' establishes an exhaustive and exclusive taxonomy: all manifest beings fall into one of these two categories by their dominant orientation. The traditional commentators note that 'sarga' (creation/category) implies not a static condition but a tendency, a current — one can move between these categories through sādhana (spiritual practice) or through negligence. 'Daivo vistaraśaḥ proktaḥ' — the three verses of the daivī sampat were the vistaraśaḥ (extensive) teaching. Now, with 'āsuraṃ pārtha me śṛṇu,' the Lord signals that the next section (v7-18 approximately) will be an equally thorough analysis — but of the nature that the sincere seeker must guard against cultivating."

How sad, how lost — to live in a world full of choices and not have the inner compass of dharma to navigate by! The three absences that follow — no purity, no good conduct, no truth — are like three extinguished lamps. Without śauca, the mind is clouded. Without ācāra, relationships become cruel. Without satya, even one's own experience of reality becomes unreliable. Dear child, this is why the Lord has given us the śāstra and the guru and the sangha — so that when our own inner light grows dim, we can find our way by the light of the tradition. The āsurī person has cut themselves off from all three.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "From the Vedantic perspective, this verse identifies the epistemological and ethical root of the āsurī condition. The inability to distinguish pravṛtti (what should be pursued) from nivṛtti (what should be avoided) is fundamentally a failure of viveka — discriminative wisdom. Viveka is precisely the first prerequisite for Vedantic sādhana (sādhana-catuṣṭaya), and without it, no genuine spiritual progress is possible. The three absent qualities — śauca, ācāra, satya — correspond to the purification of the body, the purification of behavior, and the purification of speech/thought respectively. These three together constitute the foundation upon which the higher practices of meditation and jñāna must rest. Without this foundation, what appears to be spiritual practice is merely a sophisticated form of spiritual bypassing.",
        "yogananda": "The first symptom of the āsurī condition, as Sri Krishna describes it, is a collapse of discrimination — the inability to know what should be done (pravṛtti) and what should not be done (nivṛtti). In yogic psychology, this discrimination is the function of the buddhi (discriminative intelligence) — and the buddhi is clouded when prāṇa flows predominantly through the lower channels of desire and fear rather than through the suṣumnā (central channel) toward higher centers of awareness. The three absences — no purity, no right conduct, no truth — represent the successive collapse of the physical, social, and cognitive dimensions of the person. What remains when these three are absent is the raw animal appetite — powerful, relentless, and utterly without direction except toward its own immediate gratification.",
        "goyandka": "Verse 7 opens the āsurī description (which will continue through approximately verse 18) by identifying the foundational deficit. 'Pravṛttiṃ ca nivṛttiṃ ca na viduḥ' — they do not know what to do and what to avoid. This is the failure of dharma-jñāna — knowledge of what is righteous and what is not. The tradition identifies two sources of such knowledge: śāstra (revealed scripture) and sādhu-saṅga (association with the wise). The āsurī person rejects both. The three terms — śauca, ācāra, satya — are carefully chosen: śauca is the purity taught by the dharmaśāstras as prerequisite for all ritual and ethical life; ācāra is the code of right conduct maintained by tradition; satya is the metaphysical principle that aligns human speech with divine reality. All three are absent in the āsurī person — and in their absence, the entire social and spiritual fabric unravels."

'The world has no truth, no foundation, no God — it is born of nothing but desire.' This is not merely an intellectual position; it is a contraction of the heart that has stopped looking for the sacred in anything. When one truly believes that the universe is nothing but the churning of blind desire, the natural result is to pursue one's own desires as fiercely as possible — for if there is no God and no foundation, what should stop you? But beloved, consider: even the capacity to ask these questions, even the longing for meaning that this worldview is trying to suppress — is that not itself a sign of something beyond mere desire? The very dissatisfaction with the material is the soul crying out for its Source.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is the philosophical core of the āsurī worldview, and it reads remarkably like a summary of certain strands of modern materialist philosophy. The three affirmations — asatya, apratiṣṭha, anīśvara — correspond to: (1) ontological nihilism (no ultimate reality), (2) moral nihilism (no foundation for ethics), and (3) theological nihilism (no God or cosmic intelligence). The claim that everything is 'aparaspara-sambhūta' — born of mechanical mutual interaction — and 'kāma-haituka' — motivated by desire alone — is a remarkably precise description of the reductionist materialist position. Vedanta's response is not dogmatic assertion of the opposite but the direct inquiry: who is making this assertion? What is the nature of the consciousness that claims to know that there is no ultimate reality? The āsurī mistake is using the mirror of consciousness to deny the existence of light.",
        "yogananda": "This verse records what we might call the demoniac catechism — their confession of faith in the religion of materialism. 'No truth beyond appearances, no foundation, no God, nothing but the collision of particles driven by desire.' Sri Ramakrishna observed that the materialist says 'I don't see God' — but do you see your own mind? Can you see the very awareness with which you are looking? The āsurī worldview is a tour de force of selective blindness: it uses the most extraordinary faculty in the universe — consciousness itself — to arrive at the conclusion that there is no extraordinary faculty in the universe. 'Kāma-haitukam' — caused only by desire — is the āsurī person's honest and tragic self-portrait: they have reduced themselves to the one force they have refused to transcend.",
        "goyandka": "This verse presents the demoniac creed in the form of direct speech — 'āhuḥ' (they say/declare) — making it clear these are their own positions, not the Lord's assessment. The three-part denial is philosophically systematic: (1) asatya — they deny an ultimate truth (Brahman/Ṛta) behind appearances; (2) apratiṣṭha — they deny any moral-metaphysical foundation (dharma-pratiṣṭhā); (3) anīśvara — they deny any God or intelligent cosmic governance (Īśvara). Their positive theory is purely mechanistic: 'aparaspara-sambhūtam' — the world arose from the meeting of material elements — and 'kāma-haitukam' — motivated purely by sensory desire. The classical commentators (Śrīdhara Svāmī, Madhusūdana Sarasvatī) note that this is the Cārvāka (materialist) philosophical position, included here as a warning against its moral consequences rather than as a refutation in detail."

        "dadaji": "This verse fills the heart with both sorrow and urgency. 'Naṣṭātmānaḥ' — those who have lost themselves — is perhaps the most poignant description in the entire Gita. They have not lost their bodies or their wealth; they have lost their ātmā — their very self, the thread that connects them to the divine source. And from that terrible poverty, they rise up — not in wisdom but in power — and their power becomes ugra-karman, fierce destructive action. The Lord is not speaking only of mythological demons, beloved — He is describing a very human pattern: the person who, having lost all connection to the sacred, turns their considerable energy toward using, exploiting, and ultimately destroying. Our response must be to protect our own connection to the ātmā through prayer, service, and study.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The verse brings the Vedantic diagnosis to its sharpest point. 'Naṣṭātmānaḥ' — literally 'those whose ātmā is lost' — is a striking formulation. How can one lose the ātmā, which Vedanta declares to be eternally present? The ātmā is not lost in reality but lost to awareness — covered by successive layers of māyā. When self-recognition fails utterly, the vacuum is filled by the ahaṅkāra (ego) running unchecked, which is precisely the āsurī condition. 'Alpa-buddhayaḥ' — of small intelligence — is equally striking: these are not necessarily stupid people in worldly terms. They may be highly intelligent by conventional standards. But their intelligence is 'alpa' (small, contracted) because it serves only the ego's agenda and cannot access the larger intelligence of Brahman. Vastly empowered ego-contraction is the formula for 'ugra-karmāṇaḥ kṣayāya jagataḥ.'",
        "yogananda": "The progression from ideology to action that this verse describes is one of the most important warnings in sacred literature. The materialist view (v8) is not merely an academic position — it has consequences. When held firmly ('avaṣṭabhya') and acted upon by those who have lost their spiritual center ('naṣṭātmānaḥ'), it generates 'ugra-karma' — terrible action — at civilizational scale. The word 'prabhavanti' ('they rise up') conveys not weakness but frightening power. Sri Aurobindo wrote extensively about this phenomenon — the 'Titan,' the asura, is not a feeble creature but a being of concentrated will and energy, precisely because that energy has not been surrendered to the Divine and turned toward liberation. It is like nuclear energy without a regulating principle. The world's destruction is the ultimate result.",
        "goyandka": "This verse draws the direct line from the demoniac worldview (v8) to its consequences in action. The causal chain is explicit: etāṃ dṛṣṭim avaṣṭabhya (holding this view) → naṣṭātmānaḥ (soul-lost) + alpa-buddhayaḥ (intellectually contracted) → prabhavanti ugra-karmāṇaḥ (perform terrible deeds) → kṣayāya jagataḥ (for the world's destruction). 'Naṣṭātmā' is glossed by Śaṅkara as those in whom viveka-śakti (discriminative power) has been destroyed. 'Alpa-buddhi' does not contradict worldly intelligence — one may be clever in the service of destruction. 'Kṣayāya jagataḥ' — for the world's ruin — elevates this beyond personal sin to cosmic danger: the āsurī tendency, when it gains power, threatens the very social, moral, and ecological fabric that makes human life possible."

Where the devotee takes refuge in the Lord — 'śaraṇāgati' — the āsurī person takes refuge in kāma. And this kāma is 'duṣpūra' — it cannot be filled, it only grows. The saints have always said: the way to happiness is not through satisfying desire but through transcending it — for desire satisfied becomes desire amplified. Dambha-māna-mada are the three ego-toxins that further poison this already poisoned well. And yet the most revealing word here is 'aśuci-vratāḥ' — they hold their impure purposes with the firmness of a vrata, a sacred vow! The form of commitment is there, but the content is corruption. Beloved, let us bring this same intensity of commitment — this vrata-energy — to our love for the Lord.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse gives us a precise Vedantic phenomenology of the āsurī inner life. 'Kāmam āśritya duṣpūram' — the āsurī person has made insatiable desire their ātmā-śakti, their fundamental operating principle. In Vedantic terms, kāma is a projection of ānanda (bliss) — the soul's authentic bliss is infinite, but when that infinite longing is directed outward toward finite objects, it becomes insatiable craving that can never be satisfied. Dambha (hypocrisy), māna (pride), and mada (intoxication) are the three forms of ahaṅkāra (ego) in its social expression: pretense toward others, arrogance toward self, and intoxication from external power and pleasure. 'Moha' — delusion — is the epistemological root of all this: the confusion between sat (real/eternal) and asat (unreal/impermanent). 'Asad-grāhān' — they clutch at what is not real — and 'aśuci-vrataḥ' — their vows and commitments are tainted at the root.",
        "yogananda": "The spiritual portrait in this verse is the exact mirror-image of the yogic ideal. Where the yogi renounces kāma as the great obstacle, the āsurī being makes kāma its deity — 'āśritya' means to lean upon for support as one leans upon God. Where the yogi purifies the triple ego-toxins through sādhana, the āsurī being is 'anvita' (permeated and accompanied) by dambha, māna, and mada — they are not occasional failings but constitutional features. 'Duṣpūra' — insatiable — describes the fundamental pathology of ego-based desire: it is structurally incapable of satisfaction because it is seeking the infinite in the finite. The tragedy of 'aśuci-vrata' — impure vow — is that the capacity for commitment and dedication (vrata-śakti), which is one of the soul's noblest powers, has been fully channeled into what is impure. The energy is impressive; the direction is catastrophic.",
        "goyandka": "Verse 10 continues the āsurī portrait with four sharply defined characteristics. First, 'kāmam āśritya duṣpūram' — they have taken refuge in insatiable desire; 'duṣpūra' (hard to fill) echoes the Gita's teaching in Chapter 3 (v39) that kāma is the eternal enemy of the wise, like fire that is never quenched. Second, 'dambha-māna-madānvitāḥ' — the three ahaṅkāric qualities that together constitute the social face of the āsurī character. Third, 'mohāt asad-grāhān gṛhītvā' — seizing, under delusion, what is not real (asad). The term 'asad-grāha' is theologically significant: it means they have taken hold of what is without being (asat), mistaking it for what is real (sat) — the fundamental Vedāntic inversion. Fourth, 'aśuci-vratāḥ' — their vows and firm intentions are impure. 'Vrata' normally denotes a sacred religious discipline; its pairing with 'aśuci' (impure) deliberately creates an oxymoron that captures the āsurī perversion of sacred forms."
