He has heard Krishna praise both paths, and like an earnest student, he wants clarity. Dadaji often said that this question echoes in the heart of every genuine seeker: should I leave everything and meditate, or should I continue living and working in the world? Krishna's answer will dissolve the apparent contradiction by revealing that the outer form of life matters far less than the inner attitude. The word 'suniścitam' — with certainty — reveals that Arjuna wants not philosophy but guidance he can actually live by.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse opens the fifth chapter with a question that has vexed spiritual seekers for millennia. Arjuna is asking about the apparent tension between the jñāna-niṣṭhā (path of knowledge and renunciation) and karma-yoga (path of action). In Vedantic analysis, this is the question of the qualified candidate: am I suited for monasticism, or for engaged action in the world? Krishna's answer across the next verses establishes that both lead to the same liberation — but for most people in the world, karma yoga is more accessible and thus more effective.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw Arjuna's question as a question that lives in every soul that begins to awaken. The outer seeker wants to know: which path? But the deeper answer is that the path is inner, not outer. Renunciation that is merely external — abandoning the world in body while remaining attached in mind — is not true sannyāsa. Karma yoga practiced with inner detachment achieves the same freedom while remaining in the midst of life. Yogananda taught that the highest renunciation is of ego and desire, not of activity.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that Arjuna's question arises because in Chapter 3, Krishna had already established karma yoga as superior to mere inaction, and had praised both paths in different contexts. The word 'punar' (again) indicates that Arjuna has heard this teaching before and still feels the tension. The classical tradition holds that sannyāsa in its highest form is a state of inner being, not an external condition. Arjuna's request for a 'suniścita' (definitive) answer shows spiritual maturity — he wants realization, not academic debate."}},{"verse":2,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nसंन्यासः कर्मयोगश्च निःश्रेयसकरावुभौ ।\\nतयोस्तु कर्मसंन्यासात्कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nsaṃnyāsaḥ karma-yogaś ca niḥśreyasa-karāv ubhau\\ntayos tu karma-saṃnyāsāt karma-yogo viśiṣyate","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Both renunciation and karma yoga lead to the highest good (liberation).

Both paths lead to liberation — that is the first reassurance. But then He says karma yoga excels. Dadaji always emphasized that this is not a dismissal of sannyāsa; it is a recognition of what is practically and spiritually accessible to most human beings. A karma yogi in the world, with family, work, and responsibilities — if he acts without attachment — is performing a deeper renunciation than someone who has merely changed their outer circumstances. Real detachment is proved in the midst of life, not in its absence.","sarvapriyananda":"Krishna's comparative statement 'karma-yogo viśiṣyate' — karma yoga is superior — is carefully qualified: it is superior to 'karma-saṃnyāsa' — the mere renunciation of action. This is not a dismissal of jñāna-niṣṭhā (the path of knowledge for renunciants) but a specific comparison with its pale imitation: the outer abandonment of work without inner transformation. For Vedanta, both paths converge in the same realization of non-dual Self. The superiority of karma yoga is pedagogical and practical — it suits the vast majority of sincere seekers who live in the world.","yogananda":"Yogananda interpreted this verse through the lens of practical spirituality: both paths lead to God, but karma yoga — engaged action offered to God — is more suitable for the active temperament that most souls possess. The key word is 'niḥśreyasa-karau' — both produce the highest good. God does not require us to renounce the world; He requires us to renounce our attachment to it. A mother caring for her child with love, a worker doing their job as service — these are karma yogis performing what Yogananda called 'the yoga of activity.'","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary emphasizes that 'niḥśreyas' — the highest good — means moksha, liberation itself, not merely heavenly reward. Both paths truly lead to this ultimate goal. The superiority of karma yoga over mere renunciation rests on the principle that action performed without attachment purifies the mind more actively than inaction. Goyandka notes that this verse does not contradict the Upanishadic praise of sannyāsa — it specifies that the karma yoga it compares is action performed in the spirit of full renunciation. The inner attitude is the decisive factor in both cases."}},{"verse":3,"sanskrit":"ज्ञेयः स नित्यसंन्यासी यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ्क्षति ।\\nनिर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते ॥","transliteration":"jñeyaḥ sa nitya-saṃnyāsī yo na dveṣṭi na kāṅkṣati\\nnirdvandvo hi mahā-bāho sukhaṃ bandhāt pramucyate","translation":"He who neither hates nor desires is to be known as a constant renunciant.

Dadaji would say: you do not need to change your outer life to be a true sannyāsi — you need to change your inner life. The real renunciant is not one who has abandoned home and family, but one who has abandoned hatred and desire. 'Na dveṣṭi na kāṅkṣati' — these six syllables contain the entire practice. Observe your mind: does it push away what it dislikes, does it chase what it wants? That movement of push and pull is bondage. When it stills, you are free — not in some future life, but in this very moment.","sarvapriyananda":"Krishna here redefines sannyāsa from an institutional status to an internal condition. The 'nitya-saṃnyāsī' — the eternal renunciant — is characterized not by a robe or a monastery but by the complete cessation of dveṣa (aversion) and kāṅkṣā (craving). In Vedantic analysis, these two — rāga (attraction) and dveṣa (repulsion) — are the fundamental movements of the conditioned mind that generate all karma and all bondage. When they cease, what remains is the pure Self. The phrase 'sukhaṃ pramucyate' — is easily liberated — is extraordinary: for the one who is already free within, liberation is not a distant goal but an immediate recognition.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in this verse the psychological key to liberation: dveṣa (aversion) and kāṅkṣā (craving) are the two poles of the ego's constant agitation. Every moment of suffering can be traced to either 'I don't want this' or 'I want that.' The nirdvandva — one who is beyond the pairs of opposites — is not someone who feels nothing, but one whose inner center is not disturbed by the pushes and pulls of circumstance. This is the state of even-mindedness, samātva, which Yogananda called the first fruit of meditation: equanimity in the face of pleasure and pain, gain and loss, praise and blame.","goyandka":"Goyandka's commentary notes that 'nitya-saṃnyāsī' — eternal renunciant — is a key designation. Sannyāsa here is not temporal or conditional — it is the permanent inner state of one who has uprooted the twin roots of bondage: rāga (craving) and dveṣa (aversion). These two together are called the dvandvas — the pairs of opposites — because they always arise together: wherever there is craving there is also aversion, wherever there is love for the pleasant there is fear of the unpleasant. Liberation ('pramucyate' — is completely released) comes naturally, easily ('sukham'), to one established in this inner renunciation. The outer form of life is secondary."}},{"verse":4,"sanskrit":"सांख्ययोगौ पृथग्बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः ।\\nएकमप्यास्थितः सम्यगुभयोर्विन्दते फलम् ॥","transliteration":"sāṃkhya-yogau pṛthag bālāḥ pravadanti na paṇḍitāḥ\\nekam apy āsthitaḥ samyag ubhayor vindate phalam","translation":"Only the childish, not the wise, speak of sankhya (knowledge/renunciation) and yoga (action) as separate.

Dadaji found this teaching deeply reassuring: both paths, when pursued with genuine sincerity and depth ('samyak' — properly, fully), lead to the same liberation. The argument about paths is itself a distraction. A seeker who goes deeply into either karma yoga or jñāna yoga will naturally arrive at the same truth: the ego is not the doer, the Self is the silent witness, and there is ultimately only Brahman. The paths look different at their surface but converge completely at their depths.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse resolves the philosophical debate between the Pūrva Mīmāṃsakas who championed karma and the Vedāntins who championed jñāna. Krishna's answer — that they are not truly separate — is the hallmark of the Geeta's integrative vision. 'Samyag āsthitaḥ' — properly established — is the crucial qualifier. A karma yogi who acts in the spirit of full surrender and non-attachment is, in his inner life, a jñānī. A jñānī who has truly realized the Self spontaneously acts without ego. At the summit, the two paths are one summit. The difference is only in the approach and temperament of the seeker.","yogananda":"Yogananda often quoted this verse to dissolve the pride that spiritual seekers sometimes feel about their chosen path. The meditator who looks down on the karma yogi, or the karma yogi who dismisses inner contemplation — both are 'bālāḥ,' immature. Yogananda's own life demonstrated this unity: he was a profound meditator and a tireless worker who founded institutions, wrote, taught, and served ceaselessly. He called this 'the Yoga of activity united with the yoga of meditation.' Either path, pursued 'samyak' — with complete dedication and the right inner attitude — yields the full fruit of liberation.","goyandka":"Goyandka's Gita Press analysis emphasizes the word 'samyak' (properly/completely) as the decisive qualifier. Neither sankhya nor yoga yields its full fruit when practiced superficially. The Sāṃkhya path requires not just intellectual study of the scriptures but a complete purification of the understanding (vijñāna) that results in the direct apprehension of the Self. The Yoga path requires not just external action but internal non-attachment so total that no karma is accumulated. When either is pursued to this depth, the seeker finds that the other path is implicit within it. Wisdom (jñāna) and desireless action (karma yoga) are the two sides of the same liberation."}},{"verse":5,"sanskrit":"यत्सांख्यैः प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते ।\\nएकं सांख्यं च योगं च यः पश्यति स पश्यति ॥","transliteration":"yat sāṃkhyaiḥ prāpyate sthānaṃ tad yogair api gamyate\\nekaṃ sāṃkhyaṃ ca yogaṃ ca yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati","translation":"The state attained by men of sankhya is also reached by the yogis.

Dadaji called this the Geeta's way of marking a teaching as especially important: the repetition of the verb. The one who sees sankhya and yoga as one — not as academic opinion but as living experience — has truly seen the nature of reality. What does it mean to see them as one? It means to see that all sincere paths, all genuine spiritual effort, are movements toward the same light. There is only one truth, and all authentic paths are approaches to it from different directions.","sarvapriyananda":"The statement 'sa paśyati' — he sees — in Vedantic language refers not to ordinary perception but to the direct vision of the Self (ātma-sākṣātkāra). The 'sthāna' — the state or abode — that both sāṃkhyas and yogis reach is brahma-sthiti, establishment in Brahman. This is not a place but a state of being. The one who sees the two paths as one does so not through philosophical reasoning but through the identity of their destination. When both paths have run their full course, they arrive at the same shore. The insistence on the superiority of one over the other belongs to the beginning of the path, not its end.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw this verse as a vision of spiritual unity that transcends all sectarian debate. He who sees Sankhya and Yoga as one has the vision of the sage — he sees behind the apparent multiplicity of teachings to the single truth that all teachings point toward. This is not relativism — not all paths are equally efficient — but it is the recognition that at their summit, all genuine paths of self-purification and self-surrender arrive at the same realization: 'I am not this body-mind; I am the eternal, ever-blissful Self.' The repetition 'yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati' signals this as a statement of realized knowledge, not mere theory.","goyandka":"The word 'sthāna' — state or standing-place — is interpreted in Gita Press commentary as moksha, liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Both the Sāṃkhya path (pursuit of discriminative knowledge leading to the recognition that the Purusha is distinct from Prakṛti, and ultimately identical with Brahman) and the Yoga path (desireless action as worship leading to purification and jñāna) converge on this single sthāna. He who sees their unity is the one whose perception has penetrated to the level of their common goal. This verse is a call to transcend intellectual partisanship and fix the gaze on the destination rather than the method."}},{"verse":6,"sanskrit":"संन्यासस्तु महाबाहो दुःखमाप्तुमयोगतः ।\\nयोगयुक्तो मुनिर्ब्रह्म नचिरेणाधिगच्छति ॥","transliteration":"saṃnyāsas tu mahā-bāho duḥkham āptum ayogataḥ\\nyoga-yukto munir brahma na cireṇādhigacchati","translation":"But renunciation, O mighty-armed one, is difficult to attain without yoga; the sage who is united with yoga attains Brahman without delay.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_06.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"दुःखम्","transliteration":"duḥkham","root":"duḥ (bad/difficult) + kha (space)","grammatical_form":"Adverb / adjective, neuter, accusative","meaning":"with difficulty / painfully / it is hard"},{"word":"आप्तुम्","transliteration":"āptum","root":"ā + √āp (to attain, to reach)","grammatical_form":"Infinitive","meaning":"to attain / to achieve / to reach"},{"word":"अयोगतः","transliteration":"ayogataḥ","root":"a + yoga (without union/practice)","grammatical_form":"Compound, ablative, singular","meaning":"without yoga / without the practice of karma yoga"},{"word":"योगयुक्तः","transliteration":"yoga-yuktaḥ","root":"yoga + √yuj (to unite)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one who is united with yoga / established in the practice of yoga"},{"word":"मुनिः","transliteration":"muniḥ","root":"√man (to think/contemplate)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the sage / the silent contemplative / the one of inner stillness"},{"word":"नचिरेण","transliteration":"na cireṇa","root":"na + cira (long time)","grammatical_form":"Adverbial phrase, instrumental","meaning":"without delay / in no long time / soon"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse explains why karma yoga is praised as superior: not because renunciation is inferior, but because renunciation without the inner discipline that karma yoga builds is extremely difficult to sustain. Dadaji often said that people who rush into outer renunciation without inner preparation frequently find themselves more miserable — and more attached — than before. The monkey mind does not become quiet simply because the body sits still. Karma yoga is the preparation: through disciplined action without attachment, the mind is purified, desires are weakened, and the inner stillness of true renunciation becomes natural rather than forced.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse contains an important pedagogical principle: sannyāsa as an inner state of non-attachment ('yoga') must precede and accompany formal sannyāsa as an outer condition. Without the inner yoga — the cultivation of desirelessness, equanimity, and self-knowledge through karma yoga — outer renunciation cannot bear its fruit. The 'yoga-yukta muni' — the sage who is united with yoga — attains Brahman 'na cireṇa' — without delay, quickly. This 'na cireṇa' is remarkable: it suggests that when the inner preparation is complete, liberation is immediate, not a future event. The muni has already arrived.","yogananda":"Yogananda read this verse as a practical warning against premature renunciation. Many seekers, on first tasting spiritual aspiration, want to abandon all worldly responsibilities immediately. But if the ego has not been purified through karma yoga — through service, devotion, and action offered to God — renunciation tends to produce spiritual pride, escapism, and subtle forms of the very attachment it was meant to overcome. The yoga-yukta muni — the sage established in the yoga of inner union — is free within. For such a one, liberation comes 'without delay' because it is not a future attainment but the recognition of one's ever-present nature.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary draws a sharp distinction between formal sannyāsa (the external institution of monastic renunciation) and the inner state of vairāgya (dispassion) that karma yoga cultivates. Formal renunciation without vairāgya is, as Krishna says, 'duḥkham āptum' — painful to achieve and painful to maintain. The agitation of the unsubdued mind does not cease merely because one's outer life has changed. But the karma yogi who has steadily practiced non-attachment in the midst of the world arrives at a genuine vairāgya — a dispassion born not of suppression but of understanding. From this foundation, Brahman-realization comes swiftly."}},{"verse":7,"sanskrit":"योगयुक्तो विशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः ।\\nसर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते ॥","transliteration":"yoga-yukto viśuddhātmā vijitātmā jitendriyaḥ\\nsarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā kurvann api na lipyate","translation":"One who is united with yoga, who has purified the self, who has conquered the self, who has controlled the senses, whose self has become the Self of all beings — even while acting, he is not tainted.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_07.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"विशुद्धात्मा","transliteration":"viśuddhātmā","root":"vi + √śudh (to purify) + ātman (self)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun/adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one whose self is completely purified / with a purified inner being"},{"word":"विजितात्मा","transliteration":"vijitātmā","root":"vi + √ji (to conquer) + ātman","grammatical_form":"Compound noun/adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one who has conquered the self / with a mastered lower self"},{"word":"जितेन्द्रियः","transliteration":"jitendriyaḥ","root":"√ji (to conquer) + indriya (senses)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one who has conquered the senses / master of the sense-organs"},{"word":"सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा","transliteration":"sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā","root":"sarva (all) + bhūta (being) + ātman (self)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun/adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one whose self has become the Self of all beings / one who sees oneself as identical with the Self in all creatures"},{"word":"न लिप्यते","transliteration":"na lipyate","root":"√lip (to smear, to taint)","grammatical_form":"Passive, present, 3rd person singular + negation","meaning":"is not tainted / is not smeared / incurs no karmic stain"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse describes the four-fold qualification of the karma yogi who acts without karma: purified self (viśuddhātmā), conquered self (vijitātmā), mastered senses (jitendriyaḥ), and the crown — sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā — one whose Self has expanded to encompass all beings. Dadaji called this last quality the fruit of all spiritual practice: when you no longer experience yourself as a separate entity competing with others, but as the same Self present in all, then action no longer generates karma. You act for all beings as you would act for yourself. This is not philosophy but a lived experience of universal identity.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents a sequence of inner achievements that characterize the liberated karma yogi. Notice the progression: yoga-yukta (united with yoga) → viśuddhātmā (purified self) → vijitātmā (conquered ego-self) → jitendriyaḥ (mastered senses) → sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā (self-identified with the Self in all beings). The last compound is the climax: it describes the Vedantic realization of non-duality — the understanding that there is only one Self appearing in all forms. For such a one, 'na lipyate' — no karmic taint accrues — because there is no separate ego to be the beneficiary or victim of karma. Action flows from the universal Self and returns to it.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in 'sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā' the highest realization of yoga: cosmic consciousness, in which the individual soul knows itself as identical with the universal Soul. When you truly feel the Self in all beings and all beings in your Self, you cannot act selfishly — because there is no 'other' to be selfish toward. Every action becomes an act of love for one's own expanded Self. This is why such a person, though acting continuously, is untouched by karma — the engine of karma, the sense of 'I' and 'mine' acting for a separate self, has been dissolved in the fire of cosmic love.","goyandka":"Goyandka carefully analyzes all five compound qualities listed here. 'Viśuddhātmā' means the inner instrument (antaḥkaraṇa — mind, intellect, ego) has been purified of desire and delusion. 'Vijitātmā' means the lower self (the restless mind) has been brought under the governance of the higher intelligence. 'Jitendriyaḥ' means the senses no longer run after their objects uncontrolled. The final quality — sarva-bhūtātma-bhūtātmā — is the spontaneous result of the preceding three: when the self is purified and the senses are mastered, the vision of the Self in all beings naturally unfolds. In this state, 'na lipyate' — no karma attaches — because action is performed as an offering to the omnipresent Self."}},{"verse":8,"sanskrit":"नैव किञ्चित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित् ।\\nपश्यञ्शृण्वन्स्पृशञ्जिघ्रन्नश्नन्गच्छन्स्वपञ्श्वसन् ॥","transliteration":"naiva kiñcit karomīti yukto manyeta tattva-vit\\npaśyañ śṛṇvan spṛśañ jighran naśnan gacchan svapañ śvasan","translation":"The knower of truth, united with yoga, thinks 'I do nothing at all' — even while seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, going, sleeping, breathing —","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_08.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"न किञ्चित् करोमि","transliteration":"na kiñcit karomi","root":"na + kiñcit (anything) + √kṛ (to do)","grammatical_form":"1st person singular present + negation","meaning":"I do not do anything at all / I am not the doer"},{"word":"युक्तः","transliteration":"yuktaḥ","root":"√yuj (to unite)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"united / absorbed / established in yoga"},{"word":"तत्त्ववित्","transliteration":"tattva-vit","root":"tattva (truth/reality) + √vid (to know)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"knower of truth / one who knows the real nature of things"},{"word":"पश्यन्","transliteration":"paśyan","root":"√dṛś (to see)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"even while seeing"},{"word":"शृण्वन्","transliteration":"śṛṇvan","root":"√śru (to hear)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"even while hearing"},{"word":"स्पृशन्","transliteration":"spṛśan","root":"√spṛś (to touch)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"even while touching"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse, continuing into verse 9, is one of the most practically revolutionary teachings in the Geeta.

Dadaji would ask: who is seeing? Not the ego — the ego is a construct, an apparent center. Seeing happens through the sense-organ of the eye, which is an instrument of Prakriti. The true Self, the witness, neither sees nor hears — it simply shines as the light by which all experience is known.","sarvapriyananda":"Verses 8 and 9 together constitute what Vedanta calls the 'akartā-bhāva' — the identity as non-doer. The tattva-vit knows that all action belongs to the body-mind complex, which is itself a manifestation of Prakriti (nature). The Purusha — the true Self — is the pure, unmoving witness. The list of activities in verses 8-9 is comprehensive and deliberate: it covers all the sense-organs, all the motor organs, and even involuntary functions like breathing and sleeping. No activity is excluded from this understanding. The knower of truth maintains this witness-awareness not as an intellectual position but as a living, constant recognition.","yogananda":"Yogananda called this the 'neti, neti' of action — not this, not this. As each activity arises, the yogi says inwardly: 'I, the soul, am not seeing — the eyes see. I am not eating — the body eats. I am not sleeping — the body-mind sleeps.' This is not a game or a denial — it is the practice of constant identity with the witness-Self. Yogananda taught that when this practice deepens in meditation, there comes an actual experience of watching the body and mind from within, as a silent observer. This experience of the witness is the doorway to the realization of pure consciousness.","goyandka":"Goyandka's commentary notes that the list in verses 8-9 covers all five jñānendriyāṇi (sense organs: sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste), all pañca-karmendriyas (organs of action: going/movement, speaking — in verse 9, grasping, releasing), and even involuntary functions (breathing, sleeping). The exhaustive list makes the point total: in every possible type of activity, the tattva-vit maintains the knowledge 'na kiñcit karomi' — I do nothing. This is the highest form of karma sannyāsa: not abandoning actions but abandoning the doership — the ego-identification with action. This does not lead to passivity but to completely pure action."}},{"verse":9,"sanskrit":"प्रलपन्विसृजन्गृह्णन्नुन्मिषन्निमिषन्नपि ।\\nइन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेषु वर्तन्त इति धारयन् ॥","transliteration":"pralapan visṛjan gṛhṇann unmiṣan nimiṣann api\\nindriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu vartanta iti dhārayan","translation":"— speaking, releasing, grasping, opening and closing the eyes — holding firmly the conviction that 'the senses move among sense objects' (and I am not the doer).","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_09.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"प्रलपन्","transliteration":"pralapan","root":"pra + √lap (to speak, to chatter)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"even while speaking / while uttering words"},{"word":"विसृजन्","transliteration":"visṛjan","root":"vi + √sṛj (to release, to let go)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"even while releasing / letting go / evacuating"},{"word":"गृह्णन्","transliteration":"gṛhṇan","root":"√grah (to grasp, to take)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"even while grasping / taking hold of"},{"word":"उन्मिषन्","transliteration":"unmiṣan","root":"ud + √miṣ (to open the eyes, to blink)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"even while opening the eyes"},{"word":"इन्द्रियाणि इन्द्रियार्थेषु","transliteration":"indriyāṇi indriyārtheṣu","root":"indriya (sense organ) + artha (object/purpose)","grammatical_form":"Noun plural nominative + locative plural","meaning":"the senses (move) among the sense-objects"},{"word":"धारयन्","transliteration":"dhārayan","root":"√dhṛ (to hold, to maintain)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, causative, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"holding firmly / maintaining steadily / with this firm conviction"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse completes the thought begun in verse 8, and the concluding phrase is the key to the whole: 'indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu vartanta iti dhārayan' — holding the conviction that the senses move among sense objects. The tattva-vit does not suppress the senses, does not flee from experience — he remains fully in life, speaking, releasing, grasping, blinking — but he holds with unshakeable conviction the knowledge that the senses do their work according to their own nature, while the true Self remains untouched. Dadaji called this 'inner witness consciousness' — the ability to be fully present in life while simultaneously resting in the unmoving ground of awareness that underlies all activity.","sarvapriyananda":"The word 'dhārayan' — holding firmly — is crucial. This is not a passive belief but an active maintenance of witness-identity throughout all activity. In Vedantic sādhana (practice), this is called 'sākṣī-bhāva' — the attitude of the pure witness. The indriyāṇi (sense-organs) naturally move among indriyārthāṣu (sense-objects) — this is their function in Prakriti's economy. The Purusha, the pure Self, is neither the sense-organ nor the sense-object nor the contact between them — it is the witness of all three. 'Iti dhārayan' — holding this conviction — is the essence of jñāna yoga practiced in the midst of karma yoga.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw verses 8-9 as the scriptural foundation for what he called 'practicing the presence of God.' While the body speaks, eats, moves, and blinks — all involuntary and voluntary activities continue — the soul remains in God, as God's witness. This is not dissociation from life but the deepest participation in it — full action with full inner freedom. Yogananda taught that this state is not reserved for renunciants: the householder, the student, the worker — anyone who practices inner non-identification with the ego can hold this dharana (steadfast conviction) through all the activities of daily life.","goyandka":"Goyandka's commentary on verse 9 emphasizes 'dhārayan' as the technical term for a continuous meditative conviction that is maintained without interruption. The Sāṃkhya-Yoga tradition holds that all action belongs to Prakriti — the field of nature — while the Purusha (or in Vedantic terms, the Ātman) is ever the uninvolved witness. The senses move because it is their nature to move — 'indriyāṇīndriyārtheṣu vartante' is a description of an impersonal process, like a river flowing. The jñānī does not fight this process; he simply knows he is not it. In this knowing, complete freedom (mukti) is already present."}},{"verse":10,"sanskrit":"ब्रह्मण्याधाय कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा करोति यः ।\\nलिप्यते न स पापेन पद्मपत्रमिवाम्भसा ॥","transliteration":"brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi saṅgaṃ tyaktvā karoti yaḥ\\nlipyate na sa pāpena padma-patram ivāmbhasā","translation":"One who performs actions by offering them to Brahman, abandoning attachment, is not tainted by sin — just as a lotus leaf is not wetted by water.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_10.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"ब्रह्मणि आधाय","transliteration":"brahmaṇi ādhāya","root":"brahman + ā + √dhā (to place, to offer)","grammatical_form":"Locative + absolutive (gerund)","meaning":"having offered / placing into Brahman / dedicating to the Supreme"},{"word":"सङ्गम् त्यक्त्वा","transliteration":"saṅgaṃ tyaktvā","root":"saṅga (attachment) + √tyaj (to abandon)","grammatical_form":"Accusative + absolutive (gerund)","meaning":"having abandoned attachment / relinquishing the sense of 'mine'"},{"word":"लिप्यते","transliteration":"lipyate","root":"√lip (to smear, to taint, to wet)","grammatical_form":"Passive, present, 3rd person singular","meaning":"is tainted / is smeared / is stained by"},{"word":"पापेन","transliteration":"pāpena","root":"pāpa (sin, negative karma)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, instrumental, singular","meaning":"by sin / by negative karma / by moral defilement"},{"word":"पद्मपत्रम्","transliteration":"padma-patram","root":"padma (lotus) + patra (leaf)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, nominative, singular","meaning":"a lotus leaf — untouched by the water it rests upon"},{"word":"अम्भसा","transliteration":"ambhasā","root":"ambhas (water)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, instrumental, singular","meaning":"by water / the water does not wet it (the comparison)"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The lotus leaf in water — this is perhaps the most beautiful image in the Geeta for the karma yogi's life in the world. Dadaji loved this metaphor deeply. The lotus does not fight the water. It does not jump out of the pond to stay dry. It rests on the water, grows in the water, blooms above the water — and yet not a drop clings to it. This is the spiritual ideal: live fully in the world, take on all your responsibilities, act with complete commitment — but let none of it cling to you. Offer every action to Brahman, release every outcome, and remain as untouched within as the lotus leaf is on the surface.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents the two pillars of karma yoga in a single line: 'brahmaṇy ādhāya karmāṇi' — offering all actions to Brahman — and 'saṅgaṃ tyaktvā' — abandoning attachment. These two are the complete technique. The offering to Brahman dissolves the ego's claim of authorship over action; the abandonment of saṅga dissolves the ego's claim over the fruits of action. When both are present, karma yoga is complete. The lotus-leaf simile is one of the most celebrated in Sanskrit literature: the lotus leaf's surface has a quality (lotus-effect, as modern science calls it) that causes water droplets to roll off without wetting. The liberated soul has a similar 'quality' — action and its results simply do not adhere.","yogananda":"Yogananda called verse 10 the practical summary of the entire fifth chapter. Two actions, two results: offer your actions to God (brahmaṇy ādhāya) and abandon attachment (saṅgaṃ tyaktvā) — and no sin, no karma, no bondage can touch you. The lotus-leaf image was one of his favorites. He taught that we should be 'waterproof souls' — fully immersed in life and relationships and duties, but with an inner quality of non-attachment that allows no experience to leave a permanent mark of craving or aversion. This is not coldness but perfect freedom in the midst of complete engagement.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary on this celebrated verse emphasizes the compound action: 'brahmaṇy ādhāya' is not a single act of dedication performed once, but a continuous orientation of the will — every action, moment by moment, offered to the Lord as a form of Brahman. 'Saṅgaṃ tyaktvā' is the internal complement: attachment (the sense that 'I' am doing this and 'I' will enjoy or suffer the result) is continuously relinquished. The lotus-leaf simile is exact: just as the lotus leaf's nature prevents water from sticking, the karma yogi's inner nature — cultivated through continuous offering and non-attachment — prevents sin (pāpa, negative karma) from adhering. This is the liberation that is available here and now, in this very life."}},{"verse":11,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nकायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि ।\\nयोगिनः कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वाऽऽत्मशुद्धये ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nkāyena manasā buddhyā kevalair indriyair api\\nyoginaḥ karma kurvanti saṅgaṃ tyaktvā ātma-śuddhaye","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Yogis perform action with the body, mind, intellect, and even the senses alone — having abandoned attachment — for the purification of the self.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_11.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"कायेन","transliteration":"kāyena","root":"kāya (body)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, instrumental, singular","meaning":"with the body / by means of the body"},{"word":"केवलैः","transliteration":"kevalaiḥ","root":"kevala (alone, mere, pure)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, instrumental, plural","meaning":"merely / with the senses alone / without inner identification"},{"word":"सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा","transliteration":"saṅgaṃ tyaktvā","root":"saṅga (attachment) + √tyaj (to abandon)","grammatical_form":"Accusative + absolutive (gerund)","meaning":"having abandoned attachment / relinquishing the sense of personal ownership"},{"word":"आत्मशुद्धये","transliteration":"ātma-śuddhaye","root":"ātman (self) + √śudh (to purify)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, dative, singular","meaning":"for the purification of the self / for the cleansing of the inner being"},{"word":"योगिनः","transliteration":"yoginaḥ","root":"√yuj (to unite)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"yogis / those who are united with the Divine through practice"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Krishna opens this new section with a vital clarification: the yogi acts through body, mind, intellect, and senses — nothing is excluded, the whole personality is engaged — but all of it is deployed with one purpose alone: ātma-śuddhi, the purification of the inner self. Dadaji always said that this is the secret of karma yoga. We do not act to acquire, to enjoy, to succeed, to be praised. We act to become purer. Every action becomes a cleansing fire when we relinquish the attachment that normally accompanies it. The word 'kevalaiḥ' — merely, alone — is profound: the senses do their work instrumentally, mechanically, without the ego's sticky claim of 'I am doing this.' That difference — ego-attached action versus ego-released action — is the whole of the teaching.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse distinguishes the karma yoga of the yogin from ordinary worldly action through a single pivot: 'saṅgaṃ tyaktvā' — having abandoned attachment. The instruments of action listed — kāya (body), manas (mind), buddhi (intellect), and indriya (senses) — are the same instruments used by every human being. The difference is not in what is used but in the inner attitude with which it is used. 'Kevalaiḥ' — merely — qualifies the senses: they function as neutral instruments, as a surgeon's tools, without the ego's identification. The goal declared here is 'ātma-śuddhi' — self-purification — which in Vedantic terms means the removal of āvaraṇa (veiling) and vikṣepa (agitation) from the mind, revealing the ever-present Brahman.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw this verse as the charter of action for the karma yogi. Every instrument you possess — body, mind, intellect, senses — is legitimate for use in spiritual life. Nothing need be suppressed or denied. But the inner revolution is this: abandon the attachment to results. The yogi who works in the world is purifying the inner self with every single act. Each gesture of selfless service burns away another layer of ego-encrustation. Yogananda taught that ātma-śuddhi — self-purification — is not a preliminary to spiritual life; it IS the spiritual life for the karma yogi. Through action without attachment, the soul progressively unveils its own innate divine purity.","goyandka":"Goyandka's commentary emphasizes that the four instruments listed — kāya, manas, buddhi, and indriya — represent the totality of the human psycho-physical apparatus. Nothing is left out. The karma yogi does not retreat from any aspect of life or personality; he employs all of them fully, but with the crucial qualifier 'kevalaiḥ' — in their mere functional capacity, without the superimposition of ego-ownership. The purpose declared — 'ātma-śuddhaye' — confirms that the Geeta regards karma yoga not as a worldly strategy but as a genuine path of inner transformation. Purification of the antaḥkaraṇa (inner instrument of mind-intellect-ego) is the direct preparation for the dawn of Self-knowledge."}},{"verse":12,"sanskrit":"युक्तः कर्मफलं त्यक्त्वा शान्तिमाप्नोति नैष्ठिकीम् ।\\nअयुक्तः कामकारेण फले सक्तो निबध्यते ॥","transliteration":"yuktaḥ karma-phalaṃ tyaktvā śāntim āpnoti naiṣṭhikīm\\nayuktaḥ kāma-kāreṇa phale sakto nibadhyate","translation":"The man of yoga (yuktaḥ), having abandoned the fruit of action, attains peace born from steadfastness; the man without yoga (ayuktaḥ), impelled by desire and attached to fruit, is bound.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_12.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"युक्तः","transliteration":"yuktaḥ","root":"√yuj (to unite)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the one united with yoga / the karma yogi / one who is properly engaged"},{"word":"नैष्ठिकीम्","transliteration":"naiṣṭhikīm","root":"niṣṭhā (steadfastness, firm establishment)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, feminine, accusative, singular","meaning":"born of steadfastness / derived from firm establishment / abiding and unshakeable"},{"word":"अयुक्तः","transliteration":"ayuktaḥ","root":"a + √yuj (not united)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the one not united with yoga / the non-yogi / one who is unintegrated"},{"word":"कामकारेण","transliteration":"kāma-kāreṇa","root":"kāma (desire) + √kṛ (to act/impel)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, instrumental, singular","meaning":"impelled by desire / driven by the compulsion of craving"},{"word":"निबध्यते","transliteration":"nibadhyate","root":"ni + √bandh (to bind)","grammatical_form":"Passive, present, 3rd person singular","meaning":"is bound / is completely tied / is imprisoned by karma"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse draws the sharpest possible contrast between two ways of living: the yuktaḥ and the ayuktaḥ — the one who is integrated with yoga and the one who is not. The integrated person abandons the fruit and finds peace — and not just any peace, but 'naiṣṭhikī śānti,' peace born of steadfastness, peace that is rooted and stable. Dadaji used to say: worldly peace is always conditional — it depends on circumstances, on things going your way. The naiṣṭhikī śānti of the karma yogi depends on nothing outside. It is the peace that arises when you stop demanding that life give you what you want and start offering what you have. The unintegrated person, driven by 'kāma-kāra' — the impulse of desire — grabs at every fruit and in doing so weaves ever tighter bonds around himself.","sarvapriyananda":"The word 'naiṣṭhikī' is the jewel of this verse. It derives from 'niṣṭhā' — firm, rooted establishment. This is not the fragile peace that comes from circumstances cooperating, but the peace that is rooted in the understanding of one's own nature as the non-doer. Vedanta calls this 'brahma-niṣṭhā' — firm establishment in Brahman. The contrast with the ayuktaḥ — the un-integrated one — is stark: 'kāma-kāreṇa phale saktaḥ nibadhyate' — impelled by desire, attached to fruit, he is bound. Every attachment to an outcome creates a new thread of bondage. Liberation is literally the cessation of weaving these threads, which happens only when desire is relinquished at the root.","yogananda":"Yogananda found in this verse a complete psychological portrait of bondage and freedom. The 'ayuktaḥ' — the unintegrated person — is driven by 'kāma-kāra,' the compulsion of desire. This compulsion is the ego's engine: it never rests, it is never satisfied, and every 'fruit' it obtains only generates new craving. The 'yuktaḥ' — the yogi — has stepped off this treadmill by offering the fruit to God. The resulting peace, 'naiṣṭhikī śānti,' is described by Yogananda as 'the peace that passeth understanding' — a peace that does not depend on anything the world can give or take. He taught that this peace can actually be felt physically in meditation as a great inner stillness that no outer circumstance can disturb.","goyandka":"Goyandka draws particular attention to 'naiṣṭhikī śānti' as a technical description of the peace proper to the jīvanmukta — the one liberated while still living. 'Niṣṭhā' implies firmness, finality, completion. This is not a temporary peace achieved between disturbances but the permanent peace of one who has resolved the fundamental agitation of desire at its root. The contrast with the ayuktaḥ is precise: 'phale saktaḥ' — attached to fruit — is the cause; 'nibadhyate' — is bound — is the result. Attachment to outcomes is the very mechanism of karma and bondage. The karma yogi who relinquishes fruit (phala-tyāga) is simultaneously relinquishing the mechanism of bondage itself. This is why the Geeta consistently presents phala-tyāga as the master key."}},{"verse":13,"sanskrit":"सर्वकर्माणि मनसा संन्यस्यास्ते सुखं वशी ।\\nनवद्वारे पुरे देही नैव कुर्वन्न कारयन् ॥","transliteration":"sarva-karmāṇi manasā saṃnyasyāste sukhaṃ vaśī\\nnava-dvāre pure dehī naiva kurvan na kārayan","translation":"Having renounced all actions with the mind (manasā), the self-controlled embodied soul rests happily in the city of nine gates — neither acting nor causing others to act.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_13.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"मनसा संन्यस्य","transliteration":"manasā saṃnyasya","root":"manas (mind) + sam + ni + √as (to renounce)","grammatical_form":"Instrumental + absolutive (gerund)","meaning":"having renounced with the mind / through mental relinquishment of doership"},{"word":"वशी","transliteration":"vaśī","root":"vaśa (control, will) + -in suffix","grammatical_form":"Noun/adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the self-controlled one / one who has mastered the inner forces"},{"word":"नवद्वारे पुरे","transliteration":"nava-dvāre pure","root":"nava (nine) + dvāra (gate) + pura (city)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, locative, singular","meaning":"in the city of nine gates — the body, with its nine apertures"},{"word":"देही","transliteration":"dehī","root":"deha (body) + -in suffix","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the embodied soul / the one dwelling in a body"},{"word":"न कारयन्","transliteration":"na kārayan","root":"causative of √kṛ (to make others do)","grammatical_form":"Present causative participle + negation","meaning":"nor causing others to act / not prompting external action"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The image of the 'city of nine gates' is one of the most beautiful in the Geeta. Dadaji would explain this with great warmth: the body is a city — a remarkable, complex, functioning city — with nine gates (two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, and two organs of elimination). The soul dwells in this city. The vaśī — the self-controlled one — having renounced all actions with the mind, simply rests (āste) happily (sukham) in this city. He is not the mayor running the city; he is not the police force enforcing anything. He simply lives, inhabits, witnesses. The renunciation here is mental — 'manasā saṃnyasya.' Not a change of address, but a change of identity: from doer to witness.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse introduces the celebrated metaphor of the nava-dvāra-pura — the nine-gated city — for the body. The soul, the ātman, dwells in this body as a witness, not as a doer or controller. The crucial teaching is 'manasā saṃnyasya' — renunciation happens in the mind. This is the Geeta's consistent refrain: it is not the outer life that binds, but the inner identification of the Self with the ego-doer. The self-controlled one (vaśī) has stilled this inner identification. 'Na kurvan na kārayan' — neither acting nor causing action — refers to the ātman's intrinsic nature: the pure Self neither acts nor initiates action. It is always and only the witness. To know this clearly is jñāna.","yogananda":"Yogananda loved this verse for its poetic precision. The body as a city with nine gates captures beautifully the idea that the soul is a resident, not the architecture. The gates — the nine apertures of the body — open outward to the world of experience. The soul watches through them. The vaśī — the master of himself — having renounced all actions in the mind, 'rests happily' in this city. Yogananda emphasized the word 'sukham' — happily, with ease. The inner renunciation of doership does not produce paralysis or misery; it produces happiness, because the exhausting fiction of being the controller and owner of everything has been set down. What remains is the natural bliss of pure witnessing.","goyandka":"Goyandka explains the nine gates (nava-dvāra) anatomically in the classical tradition: two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, one mouth, the navel (some traditions count this), and two lower organs — though the most common count includes the navel as the ninth. The embodied soul (dehī) is distinguished here from the body itself: the ātman is the resident of the city, not the city. 'Manasā saṃnyasya' — renouncing with the mind — is the key phrase: actual karma sannyāsa is an inner act, and it consists of ceasing to mentally appropriate actions as 'mine.' When this inner sannyāsa is complete, the soul (ātman) rests in its natural state — 'āste sukham' — rests happily — as the uninvolved witness of all activity."}},{"verse":14,"sanskrit":"न कर्तृत्वं न कर्माणि लोकस्य सृजति प्रभुः ।\\nन कर्मफलसंयोगं स्वभावस्तु प्रवर्तते ॥","transliteration":"na kartṛtvaṃ na karmāṇi lokasya sṛjati prabhuḥ\\nna karma-phala-saṃyogaṃ svabhāvas tu pravartate","translation":"The Lord (Self) does not create agency (kartṛtva) or actions for the world, nor union with the fruit of action; it is inherent nature (svabhāva) that operates.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_14.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"कर्तृत्वम्","transliteration":"kartṛtvam","root":"kartṛ (doer) + -tva (abstract suffix)","grammatical_form":"Abstract noun, neuter, accusative, singular","meaning":"agency / doership / the sense of being the author of action"},{"word":"प्रभुः","transliteration":"prabhuḥ","root":"pra + √bhū (to be, to be supreme)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the Lord / the Omnipresent Self / the indwelling sovereign"},{"word":"कर्मफलसंयोगम्","transliteration":"karma-phala-saṃyogam","root":"karma + phala (fruit) + sam + √yuj (to join)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"union with the fruit of action / the link between deed and its result"},{"word":"स्वभावः","transliteration":"svabhāvaḥ","root":"sva (own) + bhāva (nature/being)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"inherent nature / one's own essential nature / Prakriti as the inherent principle"},{"word":"प्रवर्तते","transliteration":"pravartate","root":"pra + √vṛt (to move, to operate)","grammatical_form":"Present, Ātmanepada, 3rd person singular","meaning":"operates / moves / functions / proceeds on its own"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse is the metaphysical foundation of the karma yogi's non-doership. The question arises: if the Self is the Lord (prabhuḥ) within, why does it not take responsibility for what the body-mind does? Krishna's answer is precise: the Lord — the ātman — does not create doership (kartṛtva), does not create actions (karmāṇi), and does not create the link between action and fruit (karma-phala-saṃyoga). All of these belong to svabhāva — inherent nature, the operating principle of Prakriti. The Self is the witness within, never the doer. Dadaji said: when you truly understand this, guilt and pride both dissolve. The ego takes credit and blame; the Self does neither — because the Self, as the Lord (prabhuḥ), simply is.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is philosophically pivotal. It addresses the question: if there is a Lord (prabhuḥ — the indwelling Self or Īśvara), why does the world go on with sin and suffering? Krishna's answer draws a clear boundary: the Lord does not create kartṛtva (doership), karmāṇi (the specific actions), or karma-phala-saṃyoga (the binding link between action and result). All these belong to svabhāva — the inherent nature of each being as conditioned by Prakriti and its guṇas. This protects the Lord from moral responsibility for the world's actions while locating the actual operative mechanism in the individual's own nature. Liberation consists precisely in recognizing that the true Self (prabhuḥ) was never the doer.","yogananda":"Yogananda interpreted 'prabhuḥ' here as the soul — the individualized reflection of God in each being — and 'svabhāva' as the conditioned nature accumulated through past karma and habit-tendencies (saṃskāras). The soul does not create the conditions of its own bondage; it finds itself appearing to be bound because its inherent nature (svabhāva, conditioned by past actions) generates new actions and their results. Liberation is the awakening of the soul to its identity as prabhuḥ — the sovereign witness — which was never bound, never a doer, never the recipient of karmic fruits. The appearance of bondage is exactly that: an appearance, superimposed on the ever-free Self.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that this verse is essential for understanding why the Lord (whether interpreted as the individual ātman or as Paramātman, the Supreme Self) is not the author of the world's karma. 'Na kartṛtvam... sṛjati prabhuḥ' — the Lord does not create agency — is a statement about the nature of the Self: it is by nature a witness, and witness-nature is free from doership. 'Svabhāvas tu pravartate' — but inherent nature operates — assigns the mechanism of action and result to the guṇas of Prakriti operating through each individual's accumulated tendencies. This teaching dissolves both fatalism (blaming God for everything) and egoism (claiming sole credit), pointing to the impersonal operation of natural law as the field in which the witness-Self is ever free."}},{"verse":15,"sanskrit":"नादत्ते कस्यचित्पापं न चैव सुकृतं विभुः ।\\nअज्ञानेनावृतं ज्ञानं तेन मुह्यन्ति जन्तवः ॥","transliteration":"nādatte kasyacit pāpaṃ na caiva sukṛtaṃ vibhuḥ\\najñānenāvṛtaṃ jñānaṃ tena muhyanti jantavaḥ","translation":"The Omnipresent (Vibhu) accepts neither the sin nor the merit of anyone; knowledge (jñāna) is enveloped by ignorance (ajñāna); thereby creatures are deluded.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_15.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"न आदत्ते","transliteration":"nādatte","root":"na + ā + √dā (to take, to accept)","grammatical_form":"Present, Ātmanepada, 3rd person singular + negation","meaning":"does not accept / does not take on / incurs neither"},{"word":"विभुः","transliteration":"vibhuḥ","root":"vi + √bhū (to be, to pervade)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the Omnipresent / the All-pervading / the infinite Self"},{"word":"सुकृतम्","transliteration":"sukṛtam","root":"su (good) + √kṛ (to do)","grammatical_form":"Noun/past participle, neuter, accusative, singular","meaning":"meritorious deed / good karma / virtuous action and its fruit"},{"word":"अज्ञानेन आवृतम्","transliteration":"ajñānenāvṛtam","root":"a + jñāna (ignorance) + ā + √vṛ (to cover)","grammatical_form":"Instrumental + past participle, neuter, nominative","meaning":"covered by ignorance / enveloped by nescience / veiled by not-knowing"},{"word":"जन्तवः","transliteration":"jantavaḥ","root":"jan (to be born)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"creatures / living beings / those born into embodied existence"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The word 'Vibhu' — the Omnipresent — is chosen with great care here. The Self that pervades all beings equally does not play favorites, does not accumulate merit and sin like a cosmic ledger-keeper. It is above all that. But then comes the tragic line: 'ajñānenāvṛtaṃ jñānam' — knowledge is covered by ignorance — and because of this covering, the creatures (jantavaḥ) are confused, deluded (muhyanti). Dadaji would say: the light is always there. The sun is always shining. But if we close our eyes, we live in darkness. Ajñāna — ignorance — is not the absence of the Self; it is the covering that prevents us from seeing the Self that was always already present. Our bondage is an error of perception, not a fact of reality.","sarvapriyananda":"This is one of the most philosophically rich verses in Chapter 5. The Vibhu — the All-pervading Brahman — is absolutely neutral: it takes on neither pāpa (sin) nor sukṛta (merit). This is a description of the intrinsic nature of the Self as nirguṇa — beyond qualities, beyond the moral categories that apply to the ego and its actions. Then Krishna identifies the cause of creatures' bondage in one powerful compound: 'ajñānenāvṛtaṃ jñānam' — knowledge covered by ignorance. The Self (jñāna, pure consciousness) is inherently there, but it is veiled (āvṛta) by ajñāna (avidyā, ignorance of one's true nature). The veil is not real — it is māyā — but it is experientially effective until removed by Self-knowledge.","yogananda":"Yogananda called this verse the diagnosis of the human condition. The Omnipresent God — Vibhu — does not punish or reward in the way a human judge would. The universe operates through the impersonal law of karma, and the root cause of all suffering is 'ajñāna' — ignorance of our own divine nature. Our knowledge (jñāna — our innate awareness of being the Self) is covered over by this ignorance the way a lamp's light is covered by a thick cloth. The lamp still burns, the light is still there, but darkness prevails for the one who cannot see through the covering. Spiritual practice — jñāna yoga, karma yoga, devotion — is the process of removing that cloth and allowing the innate light to shine.","goyandka":"Goyandka's commentary distinguishes carefully between the two words 'pāpa' (sin, negative karma) and 'sukṛta' (meritorious action, positive karma). The All-pervading Self (Vibhu) is untouched by both — which means liberation is not simply about accumulating more sukṛta and canceling out pāpa; it is about transcending the whole moral-karmic framework entirely through Self-knowledge. The mechanism of continued bondage is stated with clinical precision: 'ajñānenāvṛtaṃ jñānam' — the Self (jñānam, pure consciousness) is covered by ajñāna (nescience). This āvaraṇa (veiling) is the first function of māyā; the second is vikṣepa (projection of the world as the only reality). Both dissolve when true Self-knowledge arises."}},{"verse":16,"sanskrit":"ज्ञानेन तु तदज्ञानं येषां नाशितमात्मनः ।\\nतेषामादित्यवज्ज्ञानं प्रकाशयति तत्परम् ॥","transliteration":"jñānena tu tad ajñānaṃ yeṣāṃ nāśitam ātmanaḥ\\nteṣām āditya-vaj jñānaṃ prakāśayati tat param","translation":"But for those in whom that ignorance of the Self is destroyed by Self-knowledge (ātma-jñāna) — for them that knowledge illumines the Supreme (param) like the sun.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_16.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"ज्ञानेन","transliteration":"jñānena","root":"√jñā (to know)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, instrumental, singular","meaning":"by knowledge / through Self-knowledge / by means of jñāna"},{"word":"नाशितम्","transliteration":"nāśitam","root":"causative of √naś (to destroy, to perish)","grammatical_form":"Causative past participle, neuter, nominative, singular","meaning":"is destroyed / has been completely annihilated"},{"word":"आत्मनः","transliteration":"ātmanaḥ","root":"ātman (Self)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, genitive, singular","meaning":"of the Self / pertaining to the ātman"},{"word":"आदित्यवत्","transliteration":"āditya-vat","root":"āditya (sun) + -vat (like)","grammatical_form":"Compound indeclinable (comparative suffix)","meaning":"like the sun / as the sun illumines everything"},{"word":"प्रकाशयति","transliteration":"prakāśayati","root":"pra + √kāś (to shine, to illuminate)","grammatical_form":"Causative present, 3rd person singular","meaning":"illumines / causes to shine / reveals and enlightens"},{"word":"परम्","transliteration":"param","root":"para (beyond, supreme)","grammatical_form":"Adjective/noun, neuter, accusative, singular","meaning":"the Supreme / the ultimate Reality / Brahman"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"After describing the darkness of ignorance in verse 15, Krishna now shows the dawn. 'Āditya-vaj jñānaṃ prakāśayati tat param' — like the sun, knowledge illumines the Supreme. Dadaji always loved this simile. The sun does not need to search for darkness and fight it — when the sun rises, darkness simply is not. In the same way, jñāna — true Self-knowledge — does not fight with ignorance. It reveals what was always true. The Supreme (param) is not something to be manufactured or achieved; it is the nature of reality that was always present but veiled. The instant genuine Self-knowledge dawns, the veiling dissolves and the Self shines in its own light, by its own light, as its own light.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the answer to verse 15's description of veiling. The cure for 'ajñānenāvṛtaṃ jñānam' — knowledge covered by ignorance — is 'jñānena... ajñānaṃ nāśitam' — ignorance destroyed by knowledge. This is the quintessence of Vedanta's method: jñāna as the sole and direct means to liberation. The sun simile (āditya-vat) is precise: just as the sun's light does not merely reveal objects that are nearby but illumines everything within its reach, Self-knowledge does not merely resolve a few doubts — it illumines the entire supreme Reality (tat param — that Supreme, i.e., Brahman). The destruction of ignorance is not gradual; like darkness before the sun, it is instantaneous when true knowledge arises.","yogananda":"Yogananda called Self-knowledge the 'inner sun' and often quoted this verse to describe the experience of spiritual awakening. Just as you cannot see the sun and darkness at the same time — one excludes the other — you cannot simultaneously hold ignorance of your true nature and knowledge of it. When the inner sun of jñāna rises in the heart, the long night of delusion ends. Yogananda taught that this experience — the direct cognition of one's own nature as boundless, eternal, blissful consciousness — is not merely a philosophical position but a verifiable inner experience. The meditator who has even a glimpse of this in deep meditation understands what 'āditya-vat... prakāśayati param' means from the inside.","goyandka":"Goyandka places this verse as the pivot of the chapter — the transition from the description of bondage (ajñāna) to the description of liberation (jñāna). 'Yeṣāṃ nāśitam ātmanaḥ' — for those whose ignorance regarding the Self has been destroyed — points to the individual path: each seeker must attain this knowledge for themselves; it cannot be borrowed or inherited. The sun simile is elaborated in classical commentary: the sun reveals both itself and all other objects by its own self-luminous nature; similarly, Self-knowledge (jñāna) is self-luminous — it illumines both the Self and the entire field of Brahman by the Self's own light. No external instrument of knowledge can reveal the Self, for the Self is the very consciousness that makes all instruments work."}},{"verse":17,"sanskrit":"तद्बुद्धयस्तदात्मानस्तन्निष्ठास्तत्परायणाः ।\\nगच्छन्त्यपुनरावृत्तिं ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषाः ॥","transliteration":"tad-buddhayas tad-ātmānas tan-niṣṭhās tat-parāyaṇāḥ\\ngacchanty apunar-āvṛttiṃ jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ","translation":"Those whose intellect is merged in That (Brahman), whose self is That, who are established in That, who hold That as the supreme — for them, sins shaken off by knowledge, there is no return (no rebirth).","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_17.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"तद्बुद्धयः","transliteration":"tad-buddhayas","root":"tad (That, Brahman) + buddhi (intellect)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"those whose intellect is directed toward / absorbed in That (Brahman)"},{"word":"तन्निष्ठाः","transliteration":"tan-niṣṭhāḥ","root":"tad + niṣṭhā (steadfast establishment)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"those who are firmly established in That / rooted in Brahman"},{"word":"तत्परायणाः","transliteration":"tat-parāyaṇāḥ","root":"tad + parāyaṇa (supreme goal/refuge)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"those for whom That is the supreme refuge / devoted to That as the highest aim"},{"word":"अपुनरावृत्तिम्","transliteration":"apunar-āvṛttim","root":"a + punar (again) + ā + √vṛt (to return)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, feminine, accusative, singular","meaning":"non-return / freedom from rebirth / the state of no more coming back"},{"word":"ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषाः","transliteration":"jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ","root":"jñāna + nir + √dhū (to shake off) + kalmaṣa (sin, impurity)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"those whose sins have been shaken off by knowledge / whose impurities are purged by jñāna"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse describes the four marks of the one who is truly established in Brahman, and then announces their destiny: 'apunar-āvṛttim gacchanti' — they go to non-return. No more birth in the cycle of death and rebirth. The four marks build progressively: the intellect is merged in That (tad-buddhayaḥ) — the mind's understanding is rooted in Brahman. The self is That (tad-ātmānaḥ) — not merely intellectually, but existentially. They are established in That (tan-niṣṭhāḥ) — it is their lived ground. And That is their supreme (tat-parāyaṇāḥ) — there is nothing they hold higher. Dadaji said: this progression is the map of the entire spiritual life — from intellectual understanding through existential identity to unshakeable establishment.","sarvapriyananda":"The four-fold description of the liberated ones — tad-buddhi, tad-ātman, tan-niṣṭha, tat-parāyaṇa — represents a complete characterization of brahma-niṣṭhā, firm establishment in Brahman. Notice the movement from the cognitive (buddhi — intellect directed toward That) to the existential (ātman — self identified as That) to the established (niṣṭhā — rooted in That) to the teleological (parāyaṇa — That as the supreme goal). This is not a ladder but a description of the same realized state from four angles. The result — 'jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ' — is beautiful: their impurities (kalmaṣa, accumulated karma) are shaken off (nirdhūta) by knowledge, as dust is shaken from a cloth. And 'apunar-āvṛttim gacchanti' — they go to non-return — is the Geeta's declaration of moksha.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in the compound 'jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ' a description of what happens in deep states of meditation and realization: the accumulated karmas — lifetimes of impurity — are not slowly worked out action by action but are shaken off wholesale by the power of Self-knowledge. This is why jñāna yoga is described as so swift. When the fundamental error — the identification of the Self with the ego-body — is dissolved by direct knowledge, the entire superstructure of karma built on that error collapses at once. 'Apunar-āvṛttim' — non-return — was Yogananda's description of full liberation: the soul that has realized its oneness with God has no further compulsion to reincarnate, though it may choose to return out of love for others.","goyandka":"Goyandka's analysis of this verse focuses on the relationship between the four qualifiers and their shared object 'tad' — That, Brahman. All four — tad-buddhi, tad-ātman, tan-niṣṭha, tat-parāyaṇa — are different expressions of the same complete absorption in Brahman. The Gita Press commentary notes that 'apunar-āvṛttim' (non-return from liberation) is the scriptural description of videha-mukti — liberation after the body drops — as opposed to jīvan-mukti (liberation while living). But the foundational cause is the same: 'jñāna-nirdhūta-kalmaṣāḥ' — the purging of all karmic impurity by the fire of Self-knowledge. The fire of jñāna does not slowly burn away karma — it burns the very root of karma, which is the ignorance of one's own nature."}},{"verse":18,"sanskrit":"विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।\\nशुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः ॥","transliteration":"vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini\\nśuni caiva śvapāke ca paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ","translation":"The wise (paṇḍitāḥ) look equally upon a Brahmin endowed with learning and humility, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and an outcast (one who cooks dogs).","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_18.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने","transliteration":"vidyā-vinaya-sampanne","root":"vidyā (learning) + vinaya (humility) + sam + √pad (to be endowed with)","grammatical_form":"Compound past participle, masculine, locative, singular","meaning":"one who is endowed with learning and humility / possessing both knowledge and modesty"},{"word":"ब्राह्मणे","transliteration":"brāhmaṇe","root":"brahman (Supreme) + -aṇa suffix","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, locative, singular","meaning":"in a Brahmin / among the learned priestly class"},{"word":"गवि","transliteration":"gavi","root":"go (cow)","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, locative, singular","meaning":"in a cow / in the bovine"},{"word":"श्वपाके","transliteration":"śvapāke","root":"śva (dog) + √pac (to cook)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, locative, singular","meaning":"in an outcast / in one of the lowest social position (literally: one who cooks dogs)"},{"word":"समदर्शिनः","transliteration":"sama-darśinaḥ","root":"sama (equal) + √dṛś (to see)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"those who see equally / those with equal vision / the ones who behold the same Self in all"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This is one of the most quoted and beloved verses in the entire Geeta, and Dadaji returned to it again and again. The list is deliberately shocking in its social context: a learned and humble Brahmin at one end, a śvapāka — an outcast of the lowest imaginable status — at the other, and between them a cow and an elephant and a dog. The 'paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ' — the truly wise, those who see equally — do not see the social category, the species, the size, the status. They see the one Self shining in all. Dadaji would say: this is not sentimentality or politeness. It is direct vision. When jñāna is complete, you literally cannot see any being without seeing the same light in all of them. The form differs; the light is one.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the social and metaphysical consequence of the preceding teaching on Self-knowledge. If the Self is the same in all beings — as verse 16 and 17 establish — then the one who has realized this must, by logical necessity, see all beings equally. The five examples in this verse span the widest possible spectrum of the society of Krishna's time: a Brahmin at the pinnacle of social honor; a cow (held sacred); an elephant (representing royal power and natural majesty); a dog (ritually impure in the Vedic worldview); and a śvapāka (the lowest of the low). The paṇḍita — not one who has merely studied texts but one who has realized — sees the same ātman in all five. This 'sama-darśana' (equal vision) is the hallmark of Self-realization in Vedantic teaching.","yogananda":"Yogananda held this verse as proof that true spirituality transcends all social barriers. The realized soul sees one God expressing through every form — the saint and the sinner, the learned and the ignorant, the human and the animal. He taught that sama-darśana (equal vision) is not a moral position we adopt — it is a vision that spontaneously arises when the ego-veil dissolves. In his ashrams and communities, Yogananda insisted on the practical living-out of this verse: people of all backgrounds, castes, and nationalities worked and worshipped together. He called this 'seeing God in all.' The verse's deliberate selection of extremes — from the most honored (vidyā-vinaya-sampanna brāhmaṇa) to the most marginalized (śvapāka) — makes the universality of this vision unmistakable.","goyandka":"Goyandka's Gita Press commentary notes that the five beings cited represent different dimensions of difference: social status (brāhmaṇa vs. śvapāka), species (human vs. bovine vs. pachyderm vs. canine), ritual purity (cow as sacred vs. dog as impure), and scale (elephant as massive vs. these others). By spanning all these dimensions of difference, Krishna establishes that sama-darśana (equal vision) is truly universal — not limited to 'respectable' beings or fellow humans. The paṇḍita's equal vision rests on the recognition that the same ātman — pure, unmanifest, eternal consciousness — is the underlying reality of every being without exception. The outer forms differ as waves differ on the ocean; the ātman-ocean is the same beneath all waves."}},{"verse":19,"sanskrit":"इहैव तैर्जितः सर्गो येषां साम्ये स्थितं मनः ।\\nनिर्दोषं हि समं ब्रह्म तस्माद्ब्रह्मणि ते स्थिताः ॥","transliteration":"ihaiva tair jitaḥ sargo yeṣāṃ sāmye sthitaṃ manaḥ\\nnirdoṣaṃ hi samaṃ brahma tasmād brahmaṇi te sthitāḥ","translation":"Even here (in this very life), the cycle of birth and death is conquered by those whose mind is established in evenness (sāmya); Brahman is faultless and equal — therefore they are established in Brahman.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_19.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"इह एव","transliteration":"ihaiva","root":"iha (here) + eva (indeed/even)","grammatical_form":"Indeclinable adverbs","meaning":"even here / right here in this life / in this very world"},{"word":"जितः सर्गः","transliteration":"jitaḥ sargaḥ","root":"√ji (to conquer) + √sṛj (to create/emanate)","grammatical_form":"Past participle + noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the cycle of creation / birth-and-death is conquered / the round of rebirth is overcome"},{"word":"साम्ये","transliteration":"sāmye","root":"sama (equal) + -ya (abstract suffix)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, locative, singular","meaning":"in evenness / in equanimity / in the state of equality-vision"},{"word":"निर्दोषम्","transliteration":"nirdoṣam","root":"nir (without) + doṣa (fault, defect)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, neuter, nominative, singular","meaning":"faultless / without defect / perfectly pure"},{"word":"ब्रह्मणि स्थिताः","transliteration":"brahmaṇi sthitāḥ","root":"brahman + √sthā (to be established)","grammatical_form":"Locative + past participle, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"established in Brahman / those who abide in Brahman"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The word 'ihaiva' — even here, in this very life — carries enormous weight. Liberation is not a posthumous reward; it is available now, in this body, in this lifetime. Dadaji would say: the Geeta is not asking us to wait for death. The cycle of sarga — birth and death — is conquered 'ihaiva' by those whose minds are established in sāmya (equanimity, equal vision). Why? Because Brahman — the ultimate Reality — is 'nirdoṣaṃ hi samam' — faultless and equal. If you have established your mind in sāmya (equal-vision, as described in verse 18), you have aligned your inner being with the nature of Brahman itself. And when your mind is aligned with Brahman, you are — 'tasmāt brahmaṇi te sthitāḥ' — established in Brahman. This is jīvan-mukti: liberation while living.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse announces jīvan-mukti — liberation in the living body — as an accessible reality. 'Ihaiva... jitaḥ sargaḥ' — even here the cycle is conquered — is a remarkable statement because 'sarga' means the creative cycle, the very process by which individual existence arises from Brahman and returns to it. For the one whose mind rests in sāmya (perfect equanimity), this cycle is conquered not after death but now. The reason given is philosophically precise: 'nirdoṣaṃ hi samaṃ brahma' — Brahman is indeed faultless and equal. Brahman has no inequalities, no defects, no preferences. The one who has established the mind in sāmya has aligned with Brahman's own nature — and therefore is established in Brahman. The logic is elegant: like knows like.","yogananda":"Yogananda loved to cite 'ihaiva' — in this very life — as the Geeta's declaration that spirituality is not an escape from life but a transformation of it. The sarga — the cycle of birth and rebirth — is 'jita' — conquered — not after a thousand lifetimes but here and now, for those whose minds are established in sāmya. Yogananda defined sāmya as 'divine equanimity' — the ability to remain equally centered in success and failure, pleasure and pain, praise and blame. He taught that this is not emotional deadness but the greatest aliveness: to be fully present to life without being tossed by its waves. This equanimity aligns the soul with the nature of Brahman — 'nirdoṣaṃ samaṃ' — and the alignment itself is liberation.","goyandka":"Goyandka draws out the philosophical logic of this verse carefully. The bridge between human sāmya (equanimity) and Brahman is the identity of their nature: 'nirdoṣaṃ hi samaṃ brahma' — Brahman is faultless and equal. The 'hi' (indeed, certainly) is emphatic: this is not a metaphor but a statement of Brahman's actual nature. Brahman is perfect equanimity, perfect absence of defect. The human seeker who has achieved sāmya in the mind has, in effect, made the mind transparent to Brahman's own nature. 'Tasmād brahmaṇi te sthitāḥ' — therefore they are established in Brahman — follows as an inevitable conclusion. Jīvan-mukti (liberation in life) is the Geeta's highest teaching for the karma yogi: freedom now, in this body, through the mind established in equal-vision."}},{"verse":20,"sanskrit":"न प्रहृष्येत्प्रियं प्राप्य नोद्विजेत्प्राप्य चाप्रियम् ।\\nस्थिरबुद्धिरसम्मूढो ब्रह्मविद्ब्रह्मणि स्थितः ॥","transliteration":"na prahṛṣyet priyaṃ prāpya nodvijet prāpya cāpriyam\\nsthira-buddhir asammūḍho brahma-vid brahmaṇi sthitaḥ","translation":"The knower of Brahman, established in Brahman, with steady intellect, undeluded — does not exult on obtaining what is pleasant, nor does he grieve on obtaining what is unpleasant.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_20.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"न प्रहृष्येत्","transliteration":"na prahṛṣyet","root":"pra + √hṛṣ (to be delighted, to exult)","grammatical_form":"Optative/potential, 3rd person singular + negation","meaning":"does not exult / does not thrill with elation / is not swept away by joy"},{"word":"नोद्विजेत्","transliteration":"nodvijet","root":"ud + √vij (to tremble, to be agitated)","grammatical_form":"Optative/potential, 3rd person singular + negation","meaning":"does not grieve / does not become agitated / is not disturbed by distress"},{"word":"स्थिरबुद्धिः","transliteration":"sthira-buddhiḥ","root":"sthira (steady, firm) + buddhi (intellect)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one with a steady intellect / with unwavering discernment / of firm understanding"},{"word":"असम्मूढः","transliteration":"asammūḍhaḥ","root":"a + sam + √muh (to be deluded)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"undeluded / free from delusion / not confused by appearances"},{"word":"ब्रह्मवित्","transliteration":"brahma-vit","root":"brahman + √vid (to know)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"knower of Brahman / one who has realized the Supreme"},{"word":"ब्रह्मणि स्थितः","transliteration":"brahmaṇi sthitaḥ","root":"brahman + √sthā (to be established)","grammatical_form":"Locative + past participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"established in Brahman / abiding in the Supreme Reality"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse is the living portrait of the brahma-vid — the knower of Brahman — and it is painted in behavioral terms, not abstract ones. Two tests: does he exult when he gets what he loves (priyaṃ prāpya)? Does he grieve when he gets what he dislikes (apriyaṃ prāpya)? The brahma-vid passes both tests: 'na prahṛṣyet... nodvijet.' But this is not emotional suppression or stoic endurance. It is something far more beautiful: the brahma-vid's center of gravity has permanently shifted to Brahman, which is beyond pleasant and unpleasant, gain and loss, praise and blame. Dadaji said: the world still happens to him — pleasant things come, unpleasant things come — but they land on a still lake rather than an agitated one. A stone thrown in a still lake makes a small ripple; the same stone in a storm is unnoticed. The brahma-vid's inner lake is still.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is a behavioral definition of brahma-niṣṭhā — establishment in Brahman — which complements the metaphysical definition given in previous verses. The sign of true realization is not a philosophical position but a transformed psychology: 'sthira-buddhiḥ' — a steady, unwavering intellect that is not destabilized by the arrival of what is pleasant or unpleasant. 'Asammūḍhaḥ' — undeluded — is equally important: the brahma-vid is not simply emotionally controlled; he is free from the fundamental delusion that external circumstances can enhance or diminish his true nature. Pleasant things cannot add to Brahman; unpleasant things cannot subtract from it. The brahma-vid knows this not as theory but as the texture of lived experience.","yogananda":"Yogananda often cited this verse as the practical test of spiritual progress. Not: how many hours do you meditate? Not: how many scriptures have you read? But: when something wonderful happens, do you lose your center in elation? When something terrible happens, do you lose your center in grief? The 'sthira-buddhi' — one of steady intellect — is Yogananda's 'even-minded' person, whom he described in his teachings as the ideal devotee. 'Asammūḍhaḥ' — undeluded — means the brahma-vid is not confused about what reality actually is. He knows that the pleasant and the unpleasant are both passing appearances on the screen of consciousness that he himself is. From that knowledge comes the unshakeable peace he carries through all of life's vicissitudes.","goyandka":"Goyandka's Gita Press commentary notes that this verse is the direct continuation of the description of the jīvan-mukta begun in verse 19. The three qualifiers here — 'sthira-buddhiḥ' (steady intellect), 'asammūḍhaḥ' (undeluded), and 'brahma-vid brahmaṇi sthitaḥ' (knower of Brahman, established in Brahman) — together portray the fully realized sage. The optative mood of 'na prahṛṣyet' and 'nodvijet' describes not a rule to follow but a natural consequence of realization: the brahma-vid simply does not exult or grieve, as a matter of his realized nature.

The one whose mind is not hooked to sense contacts — bāhya-sparśeṣu asaktātmā — naturally turns inward and discovers ātmic joy, the bliss of pure awareness. This is not the muted pleasure of suppression but the luminous delight of Self-recognition. When such a person further unites the self with Brahman through yoga — brahma-yoga-yuktātmā — the bliss they enjoy is akṣaya, undecaying. Outer pleasures wax and wane; they depend on conditions. Inner bliss is self-sustaining. Dadaji would emphasize: non-attachment is not renunciation of the world but freedom from the compulsive need to extract happiness from it. The yogi lives fully in the world while drawing sustenance from within.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda draws attention to the compound brahma-yoga-yuktātmā — the self established in the yoga of Brahman. This is the state of nididhyāsana, sustained contemplation of the Absolute. The verse teaches a crucial Vedantic principle: joy is not produced by external objects; it is revealed when the veil of attachment is lifted. Objects do not contain happiness — they merely trigger the temporary withdrawal of mental agitation, allowing innate ātmic bliss to surface. By remaining inwardly anchored through brahma-yoga, the practitioner enjoys akṣayam sukham — happiness that does not require any external cause and therefore cannot be taken away. This is the direct fruit of Self-knowledge lived continuously.","yogananda":"Paramahansa Yogananda sees this verse as a charter for the meditating yogi. Bāhya-sparśa — external contacts — are the magnetic pulls of the senses that keep consciousness scattered outward. Non-attachment is not indifference but freedom: the yogi remains in the world yet draws sustenance from the inner fountain of Ātman. Brahma-yoga-yuktātmā points to Kriya Yoga practice — the deliberate internalization of life-force that unites individual consciousness with Cosmic Consciousness. The result is akṣayam sukham, joy that is self-replenishing because it flows from the Infinite. Each meditation session is a homecoming to this undecaying bliss, which gradually becomes the background of all waking experience.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji notes that this verse completes the logic of inner renunciation begun earlier. The outer world is not condemned; it is simply recognized as an unreliable source of lasting happiness. The aspirant who practises non-attachment — asaktātmā — turns to the ātman for joy and finds it reliably present. Brahma-yoga here refers to the constant offering of all action and experience to Brahman, living with the awareness that one is never separate from the Absolute. Such a life yields akṣayam sukham — happiness that cannot diminish because it does not depend on any finite object. Goyandkaji urges the aspirant to begin with small acts of detachment, gradually purifying the mind until this inner bliss becomes one's natural abiding state."}},{"verse":22,"sanskrit":"ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगा दुःखयोनय एव ते ।\\nआद्यन्तवन्तः कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुधः ॥","transliteration":"ye hi saṃsparśajā bhogā duḥkha-yonaya eva te\\nādy-antavantaḥ kaunteya na teṣu ramate budhaḥ","translation":"The enjoyments born of sense contacts are verily sources of suffering; they have a beginning and an end, O son of Kunti.

This is not pessimism but precision. Any pleasure that arises from contact between a sense organ and its object is conditional, and whatever is conditional is subject to change. The word ādy-antavantaḥ — 'having a beginning and an end' — captures the entire problem of transient happiness. We grasp at pleasure; it peaks, then fades; the mind craves its return. This craving itself is suffering. Dadaji would say: the Buddha (wise man) does not suppress pleasure through willpower but sees through it. Once the mind genuinely perceives the impermanence of sense pleasure, attachment naturally loosens, and the mind is free to rest in its own nature.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is one of Vedanta's sharpest diagnoses of the human predicament. Saṃsparśajā bhogā — pleasures born of sense contact — are by definition duḥkha-yonayaḥ, sources of suffering, because they operate through a mechanism of dependence, craving, and loss. The Vedantic analysis identifies three ways sense pleasure leads to pain: the anxiety of obtaining it, the fear of losing it, and the suffering when it inevitably ends. Ādy-antavantaḥ — beginning-and-ending — is the Gita's compressed statement of anicca (impermanence). Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that the budhaḥ (the wise) does not hate pleasure but recognizes its nature clearly. This recognition, not suppression, produces genuine dispassion (vairāgya).","yogananda":"Yogananda interprets this verse through the lens of spiritual psychology. The senses are outward-pointing instruments; every contact they make with the world creates a bhoga — an experiential wave in the mind. These waves arise and subside; they are ādy-antavantaḥ, transient by definition. The problem is not the experience itself but the mind's habit of clinging to pleasant waves and dreading unpleasant ones. The wise yogi — budhaḥ — observes these waves without being tossed by them. Yogananda emphasizes that meditation is the practical path here: as one tastes the unchanging bliss of samādhi, the appeal of sense pleasure naturally diminishes, not through force but through the discovery of something incomparably better and permanently available.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji reads this verse as a call to viveka — discriminative wisdom. All objects of enjoyment are born of contact; contact is temporary; therefore all worldly enjoyment is inherently time-bound and productive of eventual pain. He notes the word yoni — womb or source — is particularly telling: pleasures do not merely coexist with suffering; they actively generate it. The aspirant is not asked to become joyless but to become a budhaḥ — one who truly knows. Goyandkaji recommends reflecting regularly on the beginning-and-ending nature of pleasures as a śraddhā exercise, allowing the intellect to build genuine detachment. This is not forced renunciation but informed wisdom, the foundation of steady practice."}},{"verse":23,"sanskrit":"शक्नोतीहैव यः सोढुं प्राक्शरीरविमोक्षणात् ।\\nकामक्रोधोद्भवं वेगं स युक्तः स सुखी नरः ॥","transliteration":"śaknotīhaiva yaḥ soḍhuṃ prāk śarīra-vimokṣaṇāt\\nkāma-krodhodbhavaṃ vegaṃ sa yuktaḥ sa sukhī naraḥ","translation":"He who is able, even here before liberation from the body, to withstand the impulse born of desire and anger — he is a yukta, he is a happy man.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_23.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"शक्नोति","transliteration":"śaknoti","root":"√śak (to be able, to have power)","grammatical_form":"Verb, present, active, 3rd person singular","meaning":"is able / has the capacity / can withstand"},{"word":"इहैव","transliteration":"ihaiva","root":"iha (here) + eva (indeed, alone)","grammatical_form":"Adverb with emphatic particle","meaning":"right here in this very life / even in this embodied existence"},{"word":"प्राक्शरीरविमोक्षणात्","transliteration":"prāk śarīra-vimokṣaṇāt","root":"prāk (before) + śarīra (body) + √muc (to release)","grammatical_form":"Adverb + compound noun, ablative, singular","meaning":"before release from the body / prior to physical death"},{"word":"कामक्रोधोद्भवम्","transliteration":"kāma-krodhodbhavam","root":"kāma (desire) + krodha (anger) + ud + √bhū (to arise)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"arising from desire and anger / born of passion and wrath"},{"word":"वेगम्","transliteration":"vegam","root":"√vij (to move swiftly)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"impulse / force / the driving rush of compulsive reaction"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse identifies the acid test of spiritual progress: can you withstand the vega — the surging force — of desire and anger, right here, in embodied life, before death releases you? Ihaiva — 'right here indeed' — is emphatic. Liberation is not a post-mortem privilege; it is a present possibility for one who has cultivated the inner strength to tolerate these primal impulses without acting them out. Dadaji would note that kāma and krodha are the two great disruptors of equanimity. The yukta — the one truly united with the Divine — is not someone devoid of impulse but someone who can observe the arising storm and remain steady. This steadiness, practised moment by moment, is happiness itself.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda treats this verse as the Gita's practical standard of jīvanmukti — liberation while living. The phrase prāk śarīra-vimokṣaṇāt ('before liberation from the body') is crucial: Krishna is saying that freedom is achievable in the present embodied state. The obstacle is the vega of kāma and krodha — the impulsive rush of desire and anger — which override the intellect and drive compulsive action. The spiritual practitioner cultivates titikṣā (forbearance) — not passive resignation but the active capacity to endure inner pressure without being swept away. He who masters this is called yuktaḥ (integrated) and sukhī (happy) — two words that together define the fruit of the yogic path.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees this verse as a practical milestone on the path of Self-realization. Kāma and krodha are the two primary disturbances that keep consciousness outward-bound and spiritually enslaved. Their vega — their force — can feel overwhelming. Yet Krishna declares that the one who can withstand this force, here and now, is already a yukta — a yogi in the truest sense. Yogananda's advice: use meditation not merely as a technique of relaxation but as training in inner stability. Each time one sits calmly despite mental turbulence, one builds the capacity to resist kāma-krodha in daily life. The happy man (sukhī naraḥ) is not one free from challenges but one who has found an inner anchor that holds in any storm.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji emphasizes the word ihaiva — 'even here in this body.' This is Krishna's assurance that spiritual attainment is not deferred to another life or another realm. The present human birth, with all its difficulties, is the very ground for liberation. The test is whether one can tolerate the force of kāma (desire) and krodha (anger) without surrendering to it. Goyandkaji recommends cultivating patience as a daily sādhanā: each situation that provokes desire or anger is an opportunity to practise. He who repeatedly passes this test becomes yuktaḥ — spiritually integrated — and naturally experiences sukhī naraḥ — the happiness that belongs to an ordered inner life."}},{"verse":24,"sanskrit":"योऽन्तःसुखोऽन्तरारामस्तथान्तर्ज्योतिरेव यः ।\\nस योगी ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं ब्रह्मभूतोऽधिगच्छति ॥","transliteration":"yo 'ntaḥ-sukho 'ntarārāmas tathāntarjyotir eva yaḥ\\nsa yogī brahma-nirvāṇaṃ brahma-bhūto 'dhigacchati","translation":"He who finds happiness within, who rejoices within, who is illumined from within — that yogi, having become Brahman, attains brahma-nirvāṇa.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_24.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अन्तःसुखः","transliteration":"antaḥ-sukhaḥ","root":"antaḥ (within) + sukha (happiness)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one whose happiness is within / whose joy is interior"},{"word":"अन्तरारामः","transliteration":"antarārāmaḥ","root":"antara (inner) + ārāma (delight, garden, resort)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one who rejoices within / who finds his playground inside"},{"word":"अन्तर्ज्योतिः","transliteration":"antarjyotiḥ","root":"antar (within) + jyoti (light, luminosity)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"he whose light is within / the inner-illumined one"},{"word":"ब्रह्मनिर्वाणम्","transliteration":"brahma-nirvāṇam","root":"brahman (Absolute) + nirvāṇa (extinction, beatitude)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, accusative, singular","meaning":"Brahmic beatitude / absorption in the Absolute / liberation in Brahman"},{"word":"ब्रह्मभूतः","transliteration":"brahma-bhūtaḥ","root":"brahman + √bhū (to become)","grammatical_form":"Compound past participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"having become Brahman / one who has realized their identity with the Absolute"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse portrays the fully realized yogi with three luminous compound words: antaḥ-sukhaḥ (inner happiness), antarārāmaḥ (inner delight), antarjyotiḥ (inner light). The deliberate triple repetition of 'antar' — within — signals a radical reorientation of consciousness. The ordinary person seeks happiness, delight, and light from outside. The brahma-bhūta yogi has discovered these inexhaustibly within. Dadaji would say this is the state of sthitaprajña described in Chapter Two, now seen from another angle. Brahma-nirvāṇa — the Brahmic beatitude — is not death but the extinction of the false sense of separation. The yogi does not lose individuality; the yogi loses the illusion that individual happiness depends on external circumstances.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda highlights the phrase brahma-bhūtaḥ — having become Brahman. This is the Advaitic pinnacle: the dissolution of the felt sense of being a separate, limited individual. But Krishna does not say this is reserved for death — the yogi attains brahma-nirvāṇa here. The three 'inner' epithets — antaḥ-sukha, antarārāma, antarjyotis — describe the phenomenology of this realization: happiness that does not depend on external success, delight that is self-sustaining, and a luminosity that is not borrowed from any sense organ. In Vedanta, this corresponds to the recognition of ānandamaya-kośa as Brahman itself — pure consciousness experienced as self-luminous bliss.","yogananda":"Yogananda treasures this verse as a description of the meditator's ultimate destination. Antarjyotiḥ — the inner light — is not a metaphor but a direct experience: in deep meditation, the inner light of consciousness becomes visible to the yogi as the light of Ātman. This is what Yogananda describes in his accounts of samādhi. The yogi whose sukha, ārāma, and jyoti are all antara — internal — has broken free from the oscillation of pleasure and pain. Brahma-bhūtaḥ signifies the moment of cosmic consciousness, when the individual awareness expands to recognize itself as the Infinite. Brahma-nirvāṇa is then not extinction but infinite expansion — the yogi becomes everything.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji sees this verse as the culmination of the inner journey described throughout Chapter Five. All the earlier teachings about non-attachment and endurance of impulse have one destination: the triple inner reality of happiness, delight, and light — all antara, all within. The brahma-bhūta state is not the property of monks alone. Any sincere aspirant who persists in practice and self-surrender can taste this. Brahma-nirvāṇa, Goyandkaji explains, means the nirvāṇa — the blowing out — of the notion 'I am separate from Brahman.' What remains is pure Being-Consciousness-Bliss. He encourages the aspirant to treat moments of inner stillness in prayer and meditation as foretastes of this supreme state."}},{"verse":25,"sanskrit":"लभन्ते ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृषयः क्षीणकल्मषाः ।\\nछिन्नद्वैधा यतात्मानः सर्वभूतहिते रताः ॥","transliteration":"labhante brahma-nirvāṇam ṛṣayaḥ kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ\\nchinna-dvaidhā yatātmānaḥ sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ","translation":"The seers whose sins are destroyed, whose doubts are cut asunder, who are self-controlled, and who rejoice in the welfare of all beings — they attain brahma-nirvāṇa.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_25.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"ऋषयः","transliteration":"ṛṣayaḥ","root":"√ṛṣ (to move, to see; related to insight)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"seers / sages / those who perceive spiritual truth directly"},{"word":"क्षीणकल्मषाः","transliteration":"kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ","root":"√kṣī (to diminish) + kalmaṣa (sin, impurity, taint)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"those whose impurities are destroyed / whose sins have been worn away"},{"word":"छिन्नद्वैधाः","transliteration":"chinna-dvaidhāḥ","root":"√chid (to cut) + dvaidha (doubt, duality)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"those whose doubts are cut asunder / whose duality of mind is severed"},{"word":"यतात्मानः","transliteration":"yatātmānaḥ","root":"yata (controlled) + ātman (self)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, plural","meaning":"those with controlled selves / with disciplined minds and senses"},{"word":"सर्वभूतहिते रताः","transliteration":"sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ","root":"sarva (all) + bhūta (being) + hita (welfare) + √ram (to delight)","grammatical_form":"Compound phrase, locative + adjective","meaning":"delighting in the welfare of all beings / devoted to the good of every creature"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Krishna now describes those who attain brahma-nirvāṇa through four qualifications. Kṣīṇa-kalmaṣāḥ — those whose impurities are destroyed — points to moral and psychological purification; no sin or negative saṃskāra remains to cloud the mirror of consciousness. Chinna-dvaidhāḥ — cut doubts — refers to the decisive resolution of spiritual uncertainty through experience and knowledge. Yatātmānaḥ — self-controlled — indicates mastery of the inner instruments. But the fourth quality is perhaps most beautiful: sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ — delighting in the welfare of all beings. Dadaji would emphasize this: brahma-nirvāṇa is not the destination of the selfish introvert. It belongs to those whose love has expanded to embrace all of creation.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that this verse gives the social and ethical dimension of brahma-nirvāṇa. The third quality — yatātmānaḥ — speaks to inner discipline, but the fourth — sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ — speaks to outward compassion. In Vedanta, these are not opposed; they are two faces of the same realization. As the seeker's sense of separate selfhood dissolves, universal compassion spontaneously arises. The ṛṣis spoken of here are not isolated ascetics but beings whose purity, clarity, self-mastery, and universal love have matured together into the complete flower of enlightenment. Chinna-dvaidhā — cut duality — is the intellectual counterpart of brahma-bhūta: all felt contradiction between self and world has been resolved.","yogananda":"Yogananda presents this verse as the fourfold portrait of the liberated sage. The destruction of kalmaṣa (impurity) is the result of years of spiritual practice — meditation, ethical living, and seva. The cutting of dvaidha (doubt) represents the moment of direct experience when intellectual uncertainty gives way to gnosis. Yatātmānaḥ is the self-mastered state Yogananda describes in his advanced disciples. Most touchingly, sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ — delight in the welfare of all beings — is the natural overflow of God-union. The God-realized soul cannot help but love all creatures, seeing in each one the same Self. This is not obligation but ecstatic recognition.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji notes that the verse presents brahma-nirvāṇa as the fruit of a complete development: purity of character (kṣīṇa-kalmaṣā), intellectual resolution (chinna-dvaidhā), self-discipline (yatātmānaḥ), and universal love (sarva-bhūta-hite ratāḥ). These are not four separate prerequisites to be completed in sequence but interwoven qualities that grow together. He draws attention to the word ratāḥ — 'delighting in' — which implies not duty but joy. The sage is not serving the world as a burden; he finds genuine delight in its welfare because he sees the Divine in all. This is the hallmark of the highest realization, where love and knowledge and peace become indistinguishable."}},{"verse":26,"sanskrit":"कामक्रोधवियुक्तानां यतीनां यतचेतसाम् ।\\nअभितो ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं वर्तते विदितात्मनाम् ॥","transliteration":"kāma-krodha-viyuktānāṃ yatīnāṃ yata-cetasām\\nabhito brahma-nirvāṇaṃ vartate viditātmanām","translation":"For those wandering ascetics who are free from desire and anger, who have controlled their minds, who are Self-realized — brahma-nirvāṇa exists on all sides.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_26.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यतीनाम्","transliteration":"yatīnām","root":"√yat (to strive, to restrain)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, genitive, plural","meaning":"of the striving ones / of the ascetics / of those who persevere in practice"},{"word":"कामक्रोधवियुक्तानाम्","transliteration":"kāma-krodha-viyuktānām","root":"kāma (desire) + krodha (anger) + vi + √yuj (to separate from)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, genitive, plural","meaning":"those separated from desire and anger / free from passion and wrath"},{"word":"यतचेतसाम्","transliteration":"yata-cetasām","root":"yata (controlled) + cetas (mind, consciousness)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, genitive, plural","meaning":"those of controlled minds / whose consciousness is disciplined"},{"word":"अभितः","transliteration":"abhitaḥ","root":"abhi (towards, around) + suffix -taḥ","grammatical_form":"Adverb","meaning":"on all sides / everywhere / all around"},{"word":"विदितात्मनाम्","transliteration":"viditātmanām","root":"vidita (known) + ātman (Self)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, genitive, plural","meaning":"those who have known the Self / the Self-realized ones"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The word abhitaḥ — 'on all sides' — is the key to this verse. For the ordinary seeker, brahma-nirvāṇa seems like a distant peak requiring arduous climbing. But for the yatī — the striving, self-restrained one — who has been freed from kāma and krodha, who has mastered the mind, and who has realized the Self (viditātmā), brahma-nirvāṇa is not ahead but all around. Liberation is not a place one reaches; it is the recognition of what already pervades everything. Dadaji would say: the viditātmā does not attain Brahman — they discover they are already surrounded by it, immersed in it. The work is not to go there but to remove the obstructions that prevent seeing it everywhere.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda draws attention to the genitive case used throughout this verse: brahma-nirvāṇam vartate — 'exists for' those described. The phrasing implies that brahma-nirvāṇa is not created by the yogi's practice but revealed to the purified consciousness that can now perceive it. The qualifier viditātmanām — those who have known the Self — is the decisive one. Self-knowledge (ātma-jñāna) is the direct means of liberation in Advaita Vedanta, while all other qualifications are preparatory. Abhitaḥ — on all sides — expresses the Advaitic understanding that Brahman is the very substratum of all existence; it takes purification not to generate Brahman but to see it as ever-present reality.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees in abhitaḥ — 'on all sides' — a description of omnipresent cosmic consciousness. The yogi who has realized the Self does not experience God only in meditation; God is experienced in every perception, in every moment. This is what Yogananda calls Christ-consciousness or Krishna-consciousness — the awareness of the Divine as the all-pervading reality behind every appearance. The three qualifications — freedom from desire-anger, controlled mind, and Self-knowledge — describe the yogi who has completed the inner journey. For such a one, the world does not lose reality; it gains it, because it is now seen as nothing but the play of Brahman, surrounding the sage on every side.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji meditates on the completeness suggested by abhitaḥ — 'on all sides.' Brahma-nirvāṇa is not a narrow gate that one squeezes through; for the qualified yatī it is the entire landscape. He identifies the three qualifications as a progression: freedom from kāma-krodha is the foundation (ethical purification), yata-cetas is the superstructure (mental discipline), and viditātmā is the roof (Self-knowledge). When all three are in place, liberation is as natural as breathing. Goyandkaji notes the word yatīnām — the strivers — to encourage those who feel they are making slow progress: persistent striving in the right direction, combined with these inner qualities, inevitably brings the great recognition."}},{"verse":27,"sanskrit":"स्पर्शान्कृत्वा बहिर्बाह्यांश्चक्षुश्चैवान्तरे भ्रुवोः ।\\nप्राणापानौ समौ कृत्वा नासाभ्यन्तरचारिणौ ॥","transliteration":"sparśān kṛtvā bahir bāhyāṃś cakṣuś caivāntare bhruvoḥ\\nprāṇāpānau samau kṛtvā nāsābhyantara-cāriṇau","translation":"Excluding external contacts, with gaze fixed between the eyebrows, equalizing the inward and outward breaths moving within the nostrils —","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_27.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"स्पर्शान् बहिः कृत्वा","transliteration":"sparśān bahiḥ kṛtvā","root":"sparśa (contact) + bahiḥ (outside) + √kṛ (to do)","grammatical_form":"Accusative plural + adverb + absolutive","meaning":"having excluded external contacts / having placed sense objects outside"},{"word":"चक्षुः भ्रुवोः अन्तरे","transliteration":"cakṣuḥ bhruvoḥ antare","root":"cakṣus (eye) + bhrū (eyebrow) + antar (between)","grammatical_form":"Noun + noun genitive dual + noun locative","meaning":"gaze between the eyebrows / the eyes directed to the mid-brow point"},{"word":"प्राणापानौ","transliteration":"prāṇāpānau","root":"prāṇa (upward breath) + apāna (downward breath)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, dual, accusative","meaning":"inward and outward breath / the two primary prāṇic currents"},{"word":"समौ कृत्वा","transliteration":"samau kṛtvā","root":"sama (equal, balanced) + √kṛ (to do)","grammatical_form":"Adjective dual + absolutive","meaning":"having equalized / having balanced / making even"},{"word":"नासाभ्यन्तरचारिणौ","transliteration":"nāsābhyantara-cāriṇau","root":"nāsā (nose) + abhyantara (interior) + √car (to move)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, dual, accusative","meaning":"moving within the nostrils / flowing through the inner nasal passage"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Verses 27-28 together form Krishna's direct instruction in meditation technique, the only such instruction in Chapter Five.

Dadaji would recognize this as a description of prāṇāyāma and trāṭaka combined. The 'point between the eyebrows' is the ājñā cakra — the seat of spiritual perception. The equalization of breath corresponds to the classical kumbhaka or the natural stillness that arises when breath is observed without force, leading the mind to one-pointed concentration.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that this verse is remarkable in a philosophical chapter: Krishna suddenly shifts from description to instruction, giving Arjuna a practical meditation technique. The three steps are sequential: first, withdraw awareness from sense objects; second, concentrate the gaze between the eyebrows (pointing to the ājñā cakra or the seat of the witnessing awareness); third, equalize prāṇa and apāna — the ascending and descending breaths. This equalization creates a state of prāṇic stillness that naturally quiets the mind. Together, these two verses (27-28) describe a complete preparatory meditation leading to the state of liberation described in verse 28's concluding line: mukti-parāyaṇaḥ, the one devoted to liberation.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees this verse as a direct description of the preliminary practices of Kriya Yoga. The exclusion of external contacts is pratyāhāra — sensory withdrawal. The fixation of gaze between the eyebrows is the hallmark of Yogananda's meditation practice: the spiritual eye (the single eye of Christ, the ājñā cakra) is the point where individual consciousness meets cosmic consciousness. The equalization of prāṇa and apāna describes the neutralization of the life-current, which in Kriya Yoga is accomplished through the circular movement of prāṇa up and down the spine, progressively stilling the breath and thus calming the heart and mind. This verse is one of the Gita's most direct pointers to scientific meditation.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji reads this verse as a step-by-step instruction for dhyāna (meditation), given directly by the Lord. The first step — bāhya-sparśān kṛtvā bahiḥ — is deliberate withdrawal of mind from sense stimuli. This is the act of closing the gates of the senses at the start of meditation. The second step — cakṣuś cāntare bhruvoḥ — is concentration: directing the inner gaze to the space between the eyebrows stabilizes the wandering mind. The third step — prāṇāpānau samau kṛtvā — is regulation of breath, which directly regulates the mind, since breath and thought are intimately linked. Goyandkaji encourages the aspirant to practise these steps faithfully before seated meditation."}},{"verse":28,"sanskrit":"यतेन्द्रियमनोबुद्धिर्मुनिर्मोक्षपरायणः ।\\nविगतेच्छाभयक्रोधो यः सदा मुक्त एव सः ॥","transliteration":"yatendriya-mano-buddhir munir mokṣa-parāyaṇaḥ\\nvigatecchā-bhaya-krodho yaḥ sadā mukta eva saḥ","translation":"The muni who has controlled senses, mind, and intellect, who is devoted to liberation, who is free from desire, fear, and anger — he is forever liberated.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_28.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यतेन्द्रियमनोबुद्धिः","transliteration":"yatendriya-mano-buddhiḥ","root":"yata (controlled) + indriya (senses) + manas (mind) + buddhi (intellect)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"one who has controlled senses, mind, and intellect / master of the inner instruments"},{"word":"मुनिः","transliteration":"muniḥ","root":"√man (to think) or √mun (to be silent)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"the muni / the silent sage / one whose mind is still"},{"word":"मोक्षपरायणः","transliteration":"mokṣa-parāyaṇaḥ","root":"mokṣa (liberation) + parāyaṇa (supreme aim, devoted to)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"devoted to liberation / whose supreme goal is mokṣa"},{"word":"विगतेच्छाभयक्रोधः","transliteration":"vigatecchā-bhaya-krodhaḥ","root":"vi + gata (gone away) + icchā (desire) + bhaya (fear) + krodha (anger)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"from whom desire, fear, and anger have departed / free of the three chief inner agitators"},{"word":"सदा मुक्तः","transliteration":"sadā muktaḥ","root":"sadā (always) + √muc (to release)","grammatical_form":"Adverb + past participle, masculine, nominative, singular","meaning":"always liberated / forever free / perpetually released"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse completes the meditation instruction of verse 27 with the declaration of its fruit: sadā mukta — always free. The muni (silent sage) described here has controlled the entire inner hierarchy: indriya (senses), manas (mind), and buddhi (intellect). Three inner tormentors have departed: icchā (desire), bhaya (fear), and krodha (anger). These are not coincidental; they are the three roots of bondage. Desire attaches consciousness to what is absent; fear attaches it to what might be lost; anger arises when desire is frustrated. When all three are gone, nothing can disturb the inner peace. Dadaji emphasizes sadā — 'always.' This freedom is not the peace of deep sleep or the temporary calm of meditation, but freedom that persists in all states.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda sees in this verse the completion of jīvanmukti — liberation while living. The compound yatendriya-mano-buddhiḥ maps onto the classical Vedantic teaching of śama (control of mind), dama (control of senses), and uparati (withdrawal of intellect from sense-objects). Mokṣa-parāyaṇaḥ — devoted to liberation as the supreme aim — describes the orientation of the jijñāsu who has not yet arrived but is irreversibly pointed toward the goal. The final verse says: yaḥ sadā mukta eva saḥ — 'he is indeed always free.' The word eva is emphatic: not just free sometimes, not just free in samādhi, but always, inherently, already free. This is the recognition of what was never bound.","yogananda":"Yogananda reads this verse as the description of the perfected Kriya Yogi. Yatendriya-mano-buddhiḥ — the control of senses, mind, and intellect — is the fruit of sustained pranayama and meditation practice over years and lifetimes. Mokṣa-parāyaṇaḥ is the one-pointed devotion to God-realization that Yogananda demanded of his disciples above all else. The departure of icchā, bhaya, and krodha is the natural consequence: the yogi who has tasted samādhi no longer craves sense objects, no longer fears death, and no longer reacts with anger to frustration. The result — sadā muktaḥ — is the goal of all yogic effort: to live permanently in the freedom that is the Self's true nature.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji treats this verse as the culminating answer to Arjuna's implicit question: what does the liberated person actually look like? Three instruments are mastered: senses (indriya), mind (manas), intellect (buddhi). Three afflictions are gone: desire (icchā), fear (bhaya), anger (krodha). One supreme orientation is present: mokṣa-parāyaṇaḥ — liberation as the north star of life. When these conditions are fulfilled, sadā mukta eva — always free indeed. Goyandkaji notes that this verse can also be read as a checklist for the serious aspirant: how far have I gone in controlling these inner instruments? How much have these three afflictions diminished? Progress on these measures is progress toward sadā mukti."}},{"verse":29,"sanskrit":"भोक्तारं यज्ञतपसां सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम् ।\\nसुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति ॥","transliteration":"bhoktāraṃ yajña-tapasāṃ sarva-loka-maheśvaram\\nsuhṛdaṃ sarva-bhūtānāṃ jñātvā māṃ śāntim ṛcchati","translation":"Knowing Me as the enjoyer of all sacrifices and austerities, the great Lord of all worlds, the friend of all beings — he attains peace.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch05/verse_05_29.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"भोक्तारम्","transliteration":"bhoktāram","root":"√bhuj (to enjoy, to experience)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, accusative, singular (agent noun)","meaning":"the enjoyer / the experiencer / the one who receives the fruits"},{"word":"यज्ञतपसाम्","transliteration":"yajña-tapasām","root":"yajña (sacrifice, worship) + tapas (austerity, heat)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, genitive, plural","meaning":"of all sacrifices and austerities / of all acts of worship and self-discipline"},{"word":"सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम्","transliteration":"sarva-loka-maheśvaram","root":"sarva (all) + loka (world) + mahā (great) + īśvara (lord)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"the great Lord of all worlds / the supreme sovereign of every plane of existence"},{"word":"सुहृदम्","transliteration":"suhṛdam","root":"su (good, well) + hṛd (heart)","grammatical_form":"Noun/adjective, masculine, accusative, singular","meaning":"the friend / the well-wisher / the one with a good heart towards all"},{"word":"शान्तिम् ऋच्छति","transliteration":"śāntim ṛcchati","root":"śānti (peace) + √ṛ or √ṛch (to go, to attain)","grammatical_form":"Noun accusative + verb present 3rd singular","meaning":"attains peace / reaches śānti / arrives at the supreme stillness"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The final verse of Chapter Five is among the most beloved in the entire Gita. Krishna reveals three aspects of Himself as the key to peace: He is the bhoktā — the ultimate enjoyer and recipient of all sacrifice and tapas; He is the sarva-loka-maheśvara — the supreme Lord of all worlds; and He is the suhṛd — the friend, the well-wisher of all beings. Dadaji would dwell on this last word: suhṛd. Not judge, not distant deity, but friend — one with a good heart toward every creature. Knowing this threefold nature of the Divine through direct experience (jñātvā), not merely intellectual assent, brings śānti — the profound peace that is the goal of all spiritual seeking. The chapter closes not with a technique but with a name: māṃ jñātvā — 'knowing Me.'","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda sees this verse as the Gita's encapsulation of the relationship between jñāna and bhakti. All the earlier verses of Chapter Five have emphasized knowledge, discrimination, and inner control. But the chapter closes with a devotional note: know Me — māṃ jñātvā — and attain peace. The three epithets of God are carefully chosen. Bhoktāraṃ yajña-tapasāṃ: God is not indifferent to our spiritual efforts; He receives and enjoys them — all worship and all tapas reach Him ultimately. Sarva-loka-maheśvaram: He is not a local deity but the sovereign of every plane of existence. Suhṛdaṃ sarva-bhūtānāṃ: He is the universal friend, bearing goodwill toward every being. Knowing this brings śānti — not just calm but the peace that surpasses understanding.","yogananda":"Yogananda regards this verse as one of the most comforting in the Gita. After chapters of demanding instruction on renunciation, non-attachment, and inner control, Krishna ends with a declaration of His own nature as the cosmic friend of all beings. Suhṛdaṃ sarva-bhūtānāṃ — 'the friend of all beings' — is a direct statement that the universe is not hostile, indifferent, or mechanical but is presided over by a Being of infinite goodwill. The devotee who truly knows this — jñātvā māṃ — is released from anxiety, competition, and existential loneliness. Śāntim ṛcchati: peace comes not from controlling the world but from knowing the nature of the One who holds the world. This is the devotional crown of Chapter Five.","goyandka":"Goyandkaji treats this closing verse as a summary of the entire chapter in theistic terms. Chapter Five has guided the aspirant from action (karma-yoga) through renunciation and equanimity to the inner peace of brahma-nirvāṇa. Here Krishna reveals the personal ground of all that impersonal teaching: behind the Absolute is a Person — the great Lord who is simultaneously the sovereign of all worlds and the intimate friend of every heart. Jñātvā — 'having known' — is the decisive word. This is not theoretical knowledge but realization born of practice and grace. Goyandkaji encourages the aspirant to offer all their sacrifices, austerities, and meditations to this divine friend, knowing that every sincere effort is received and that śānti — the peace of the Lord — is the certain and glorious result."}}]`),t={chapter:5,verses:e};export{a as chapter,t as default,e as verses};
