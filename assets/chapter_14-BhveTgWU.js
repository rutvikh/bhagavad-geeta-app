He is not tired of giving; He is eager to give you more and more. This knowledge He is about to share is 'jñānānāṃ jñānam uttamam' — the supreme jewel of all knowledges, the very knowledge that freed all the great sages. Sit with open hands, open heart. What the rishis received and were liberated by, that same grace is flowing to you right now through these words.","sarvapriyananda":"Śaṅkara notes that this chapter presents the highest Vedantic analysis of bondage: how the One Ātman comes to appear bound through the mechanism of the three guṇas. The word 'uttamam' here is definitive — this teaching about the guṇas is placed above all other levels of instruction because it goes directly to the mechanism of saṃsāra itself. Once the seeker clearly understands how the guṇas bind, the path to guṇātīta-state — transcending the guṇas — becomes vivid. The sages who 'went from here to the highest' are the jīvanmuktas who realized the Ātman as untouched by Prakṛti.","yogananda":"The master speaks with cosmic enthusiasm — 'I shall tell you again!' because this wisdom of the three guṇas is the master-key to self-liberation. Every human condition, every state of consciousness, every experience in creation is a play of sattva, rajas, and tamas. When you truly understand these three forces, you see through the entire dream of creation. The sages who attained 'parāṃ siddhim' — the supreme perfection — did not merely accumulate more spiritual experiences; they went beyond all guṇa-conditioned experience entirely and merged in the Infinite. This is the knowledge that sets you permanently free.","goyandka":"The Bhagavān opens this fourteenth chapter by asserting the supremacy of the knowledge He is about to impart. 'Jñānānāṃ jñānam uttamam' identifies this teaching as the apex of all revealed knowledge because it addresses the root cause of bondage. The word 'munayaḥ' refers specifically to those who have taken to contemplative silence and inner inquiry — they, by mastering this knowledge of the guṇas, attained 'parāṃ siddhim,' which the commentators uniformly interpret as mokṣa, the final release from the cycle of birth and death."}},{"verse":2,"sanskrit":"इदं ज्ञानम् उपाश्रित्य मम साधर्म्यम् आगताः । सर्गेऽपि नोपजायन्ते प्रलये न व्यथन्ति च ॥","transliteration":"idaṃ jñānam upāśritya mama sādharmyam āgatāḥ | sarge api nopajāyante pralaye na vyathanti ca ||","translation":"Those souls who take shelter in this sacred wisdom and attain My very own divine nature are untouched by the great tides of creation and dissolution — neither reborn when worlds unfold, nor shaken when they return to the Unmanifest.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_02.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"इदम्","transliteration":"idam","root":"idam (demonstrative pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"demonstrative pronoun, accusative singular, neuter","meaning":"this"},{"word":"ज्ञानम्","transliteration":"jñānam","root":"jñā (to know)","grammatical_form":"noun, accusative singular, neuter","meaning":"knowledge"},{"word":"उपाश्रित्य","transliteration":"upāśritya","root":"śri (to resort to, to take shelter) with prefix upa-ā-","grammatical_form":"indeclinable gerund (absolutive/ktvānta)","meaning":"taking refuge in, relying upon"},{"word":"मम","transliteration":"mama","root":"mad (first person pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"personal pronoun, genitive singular, first person","meaning":"My"},{"word":"साधर्म्यम्","transliteration":"sādharmyam","root":"sa (same) + dharma (nature, law, essence)","grammatical_form":"noun, accusative singular, neuter","meaning":"same nature, same essential state, likeness"},{"word":"आगताः","transliteration":"āgatāḥ","root":"gam (to go) with prefix ā-","grammatical_form":"past passive participle, nominative plural, masculine","meaning":"having attained, those who have come to"},{"word":"सर्गे","transliteration":"sarge","root":"sṛj (to create, to emit)","grammatical_form":"noun, locative singular, masculine","meaning":"at creation, at the manifestation of the universe"},{"word":"अपि","transliteration":"api","root":"api (enclitic particle)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable particle","meaning":"even, also"},{"word":"न उपजायन्ते","transliteration":"na upajāyante","root":"na (negation) + jan (to be born) with prefix upa-","grammatical_form":"negative particle + verb, third person plural, present tense, passive, ātmanepada","meaning":"are not born, do not take birth"},{"word":"प्रलये","transliteration":"pralaye","root":"lī (to dissolve, to merge) with prefix pra-","grammatical_form":"noun, locative singular, masculine","meaning":"at dissolution, at the cosmic ending"},{"word":"न व्यथन्ति","transliteration":"na vyathanti","root":"na (negation) + vyath (to tremble, to be agitated)","grammatical_form":"negative particle + verb, third person plural, present tense, active, parasmaipada","meaning":"are not troubled, are not agitated, do not suffer"},{"word":"च","transliteration":"ca","root":"ca (enclitic conjunction)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable conjunction","meaning":"and"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"What is liberation? It is 'mama sādharmyam' — attaining the same nature as the Lord Himself. This is not a small thing the Lord is offering; He is offering His own Being. Once this knowledge is truly received and lived, even the great cosmic tides — creation and dissolution — cannot touch you. You are neither born again when the worlds unfold, nor do you tremble when they are swallowed back into the Unmanifest. This is the fearlessness that comes only from resting in the Lord's own nature.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse establishes the Advaitic ideal of sāyujya — merger with the ultimate reality. 'Mama sādharmyam' is interpreted by Śaṅkara as the attainment of Brahman-nature itself, not merely proximity to the Lord. The liberated soul is not reborn in sarga (creation) because there is no residual avidyā to fuel another embodiment. Nor is it 'troubled' at pralaya — because there is no separate ego left to be troubled. The language here transcends even the jivanmukta state, pointing to the videhamukta, the one who is free even beyond the body, beyond cosmic time.","yogananda":"When the great sages discovered that their innermost Self was one with the Cosmic Consciousness, they stepped outside the law of creation and dissolution forever. 'Sarge api nopajāyante' — even when the entire universe bursts forth again from the Cosmic Dream, they do not reappear as separate beings subject to illusion. They have merged into the Dreamer. How magnificent is this promise! The entire cosmic spectacle of creation and destruction is like waves rising and falling in the ocean — the one who has become the Ocean itself is unmoved, untouched, unstirred by any wave.","goyandka":"The practical import of this verse is profound: the value of the jñāna being taught is demonstrated by its ultimate fruit — attainment of the Lord's own essential nature (sādharmyam). Commentators distinguish this from sāmīpya (nearness) or sālokya (dwelling in the same realm); sādharmyam points to the highest liberation where the distinction between worshipper and worshipped dissolves. The immunity to sarga and pralaya — the cosmic cycles of birth and dissolution — confirms this is the state of Brahman-realization, beyond all conditional existence."}},{"verse":3,"sanskrit":"मम योनिर् महद् ब्रह्म तस्मिन् गर्भं दधाम्य् अहम् । सम्भवः सर्व-भूतानां ततो भवति भारत ॥","transliteration":"mama yoniḥ mahad brahma tasmin garbhaṃ dadhāmy aham | sambhavaḥ sarva-bhūtānāṃ tato bhavati bhārata ||","translation":"The great cosmic Nature is My womb, O Arjuna; into Her I place the seed of consciousness, and from that divine union the birth of all beings throughout creation comes to pass.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_03.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"मम","transliteration":"mama","root":"mad (first person pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"personal pronoun, genitive singular, first person","meaning":"My"},{"word":"योनिः","transliteration":"yoniḥ","root":"yu (to join, to unite) — or primary noun","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, feminine","meaning":"womb, source, matrix"},{"word":"महद् ब्रह्म","transliteration":"mahad brahma","root":"mahat (great) + bṛh (to expand, to grow)","grammatical_form":"adjective + noun, nominative singular, neuter (compound predicate)","meaning":"the great Brahman, Mahad (the primordial Prakṛti/Nature)"},{"word":"तस्मिन्","transliteration":"tasmin","root":"tad (demonstrative pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"demonstrative pronoun, locative singular, neuter","meaning":"in that, therein"},{"word":"गर्भम्","transliteration":"garbham","root":"garbh (to conceive, to hold inside) — or primary noun","grammatical_form":"noun, accusative singular, masculine","meaning":"the seed, the embryo, the germ"},{"word":"दधामि","transliteration":"dadhāmi","root":"dhā (to place, to put, to hold)","grammatical_form":"verb, first person singular, present tense, active, parasmaipada","meaning":"I place, I deposit"},{"word":"अहम्","transliteration":"aham","root":"asmad (first person pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"personal pronoun, nominative singular, first person","meaning":"I"},{"word":"सम्भवः","transliteration":"sambhavaḥ","root":"bhū (to become, to be) with prefix sam-","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"birth, coming into being, origin"},{"word":"सर्व-भूतानाम्","transliteration":"sarva-bhūtānām","root":"sarva (all) + bhū (to be, to exist)","grammatical_form":"tatpuruṣa compound, genitive plural, neuter","meaning":"of all beings (genitive plural)"},{"word":"ततः","transliteration":"tataḥ","root":"tad (demonstrative pronoun base) — ablative adverb","grammatical_form":"indeclinable adverb (ablative origin)","meaning":"from that, therefore"},{"word":"भवति","transliteration":"bhavati","root":"bhū (to become, to be)","grammatical_form":"verb, third person singular, present tense, active, parasmaipada","meaning":"comes to be, occurs, happens"},{"word":"भारत","transliteration":"bhārata","root":"Bharata (proper noun — ancestor of the Kuru clan)","grammatical_form":"vocative singular, masculine (patronymic epithet)","meaning":"O Bhārata (Arjuna, descendant of Bharata)"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"See the Lord's tenderness in this verse: He calls the great Prakṛti 'My womb' and places within Her His own seed of consciousness. Every being that has ever lived is the child of this divine union — you are not an accident or a random formation of matter. You are the beloved child of the Lord Himself, born from His own love meeting the cosmic womb. The next time you look at any creature — human, animal, bird, insect — remember: this is the Lord's own child, born from His own seed placed in His own cosmic womb.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the Sāṃkhya-Yoga cosmology in its purest Gītā form. 'Mahad brahma' refers to the Mahat-tattva or primordial Prakṛti — not Brahman in the Advaitic sense, but the highest manifest principle of Nature. The Lord as Puruṣa-supreme places the 'garbha' — the seed of individual consciousness — into Prakṛti, and from this union all individual beings arise. Śaṅkara interprets the Lord here as the Paramātman who, through His mere presence (sannidhi), causes Prakṛti to manifest. This preserves Advaita: the Lord does not actually 'act' but His presence catalyzes the entire creation.","yogananda":"In this single verse, the Gītā reveals the mystery of all creation. The Cosmic Mother (Prakṛti) receives the seed of the Cosmic Father (Puruṣa, the Lord), and from this mystical union every living being is born — from the smallest microbe to the greatest archangel. The 'garbham' that the Lord places is not merely physical; it is the spark of divine consciousness, the seed of self-awareness, that makes every being alive and aware. You are literally a child of God in the most direct and cosmic sense — not metaphorically, but as a matter of universal law.","goyandka":"The cosmological vision here follows the Sāṃkhya darśana which posits Prakṛti (here called 'mahad brahma' — the great basis or primordial field) as the material cause of the universe, while the Puruṣa (the Lord) is the efficient cause who 'places the seed.' The word 'garbham' is significant: it means both seed and embryo, indicating that the Lord's presence within Prakṛti is the very life-principle that animates all creation. 'Sarva-bhūtānāṃ sambhavaḥ' — the origin of all beings — confirms this is a universal cosmological statement with no exceptions."}},{"verse":4,"sanskrit":"सर्व-योनिषु कौन्तेय मूर्तयः सम्भवन्ति याः । तासां ब्रह्म महद् योनिर् अहं बीज-प्रदः पिता ॥","transliteration":"sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ | tāsāṃ brahma mahad yoniḥ ahaṃ bīja-pradaḥ pitā ||","translation":"Whatever forms arise in any womb throughout all creation, O son of Kunti — the great cosmic Nature is their mother-womb, and I am the eternal Father who places within every form the divine seed of conscious life.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_04.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"सर्व-योनिषु","transliteration":"sarva-yoniṣu","root":"sarva (all) + yu (to join) / yoni (womb, source)","grammatical_form":"tatpuruṣa compound, locative plural, feminine","meaning":"in all wombs, in all kinds of births"},{"word":"कौन्तेय","transliteration":"kaunteya","root":"Kuntī (proper noun — mother of Arjuna)","grammatical_form":"vocative singular, masculine (patronymic epithet)","meaning":"O son of Kuntī (Arjuna)"},{"word":"मूर्तयः","transliteration":"mūrtayaḥ","root":"mūrti (form, body, embodied form)","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative plural, feminine","meaning":"forms, bodies, embodied beings"},{"word":"सम्भवन्ति","transliteration":"sambhavanti","root":"bhū (to become) with prefix sam-","grammatical_form":"verb, third person plural, present tense, active, parasmaipada","meaning":"are born, come into being"},{"word":"याः","transliteration":"yāḥ","root":"ya (relative pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"relative pronoun, nominative plural, feminine","meaning":"which (relative pronoun)"},{"word":"तासाम्","transliteration":"tāsām","root":"tad (demonstrative pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"demonstrative pronoun, genitive plural, feminine","meaning":"of them, of all those"},{"word":"ब्रह्म महद्","transliteration":"brahma mahad","root":"bṛh (to expand) + mahat (great)","grammatical_form":"noun + adjective, nominative singular, neuter","meaning":"the great Brahman, primordial Prakṛti"},{"word":"योनिः","transliteration":"yoniḥ","root":"yu (to join) / primary noun","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, feminine","meaning":"the womb, the source"},{"word":"अहम्","transliteration":"aham","root":"asmad (first person pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"personal pronoun, nominative singular, first person","meaning":"I"},{"word":"बीज-प्रदः","transliteration":"bīja-pradaḥ","root":"bīja (seed) + pra-dā (to give, to bestow)","grammatical_form":"tatpuruṣa compound, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"the seed-giver, one who bestows the seed"},{"word":"पिता","transliteration":"pitā","root":"pā (to protect, to nourish) — primary noun","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"the Father"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The Lord extends the teaching to its universal limit: 'sarva-yoniṣu' — in ALL wombs, in every kind of birth across the entire creation. There is not a single creature born anywhere in this universe who is not His child. He says plainly: 'I am the seed-giving Father.' When the great Masters spoke of seeing God in all beings, this is the foundation — it is literally true. Every form before you carries the Lord's own seed within it. This understanding is the root of genuine love and the death of all contempt.","sarvapriyananda":"Verse 3 established the general cosmological principle; verse 4 universalizes it without exception. 'Sarva-yoniṣu' — every category of birth, every species, every realm of existence — all draw their essential life-spark from the same source: the Lord as 'bīja-pradaḥ pitā,' the Father who gives the seed of consciousness. The use of 'pitā' (Father) alongside 'mahad brahma' as 'yoniḥ' (Mother-womb) gives us the complete Sāṃkhya-Vedāntic picture: Prakṛti is the material womb, Puruṣa is the consciousness that vivifies. No being stands outside this cosmic parentage.","yogananda":"When the great sage Ramakrishna saw God in every being — prostrating to a prostitute, serving a criminal — this verse was his metaphysical foundation. Every single form born in any womb anywhere in the cosmos carries the divine seed of the Father. The variety of forms is Prakṛti's creativity; the consciousness within every form is the Lord's own gift. To harm any creature knowingly is to strike at the Father's own child. To serve any being selflessly is to worship the Father directly. This is the deepest logic of ahiṃsā and of universal service.","goyandka":"This verse completes the cosmological dyad begun in verse 3. While verse 3 stated the principle of cosmic generation, verse 4 makes it universal and personal: 'ahaṃ bīja-pradaḥ pitā' — I am the Father who gives the seed. The term 'bīja-pradaḥ' is technically precise: the bīja (seed) is the cetana (consciousness-principle) without which no form of life is possible. The Lord is not merely a distant first cause but an ever-present Father whose seed of awareness animates every living form in all the fourteen worlds."}},{"verse":5,"sanskrit":"सत्त्वं रजस् तम इति गुणाः प्रकृति-सम्भवाः । निबध्नन्ति महाबाहो देहे देहिनम् अव्ययम् ॥","transliteration":"sattvaṃ rajas tamaḥ iti guṇāḥ prakṛti-sambhavāḥ | nibadhnanti mahābāho dehe dehinam avyayam ||","translation":"Sattva, rajas, and tamas — the three great strands born of Nature — bind the eternal, imperishable Soul within the body, O Mighty-Armed.

The soul — 'avyayam dehinam,' the imperishable, eternal one — is not intrinsically bound. It is free by its very nature! But the three strands of Prakṛti, like ropes woven of light, passion, and darkness, tie this free soul into the experience of a body and a world. The Lord addresses Arjuna as 'Mahābāho' — Mighty-Armed — reminding him: you have the strength within you to unbind yourself. The guṇas are not the enemy; they are the veil. And veils can be lifted.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse announces the central thesis of the entire chapter. Notice the crucial phrase 'prakṛti-sambhavāḥ' — the guṇas are born of Prakṛti, not of the Puruṣa. The soul (dehin) is qualified as 'avyayam' — imperishable, eternal, and by implication free. The binding (nibadhnanti) is therefore not essential to the soul's nature but is a superimposition (adhyāsa). Śaṅkara would say: the soul appears bound but is never actually bound — it is like the sky that appears filled with clouds; the sky is untouched. Liberation is recognizing this unchanging truth about one's own essential nature.","yogananda":"The word 'avyayam' holds the entire key to liberation. The soul is imperishable, immutable, eternally free — and yet it appears bound. How? Through the three guṇas of Prakṛti, which act like magnetic fields pulling consciousness into identification with the body and its experiences. Sattva creates the magnetic pull of beauty and wisdom; rajas creates the pull of desire and ambition; tamas creates the pull of ignorance and inertia. The spiritual path is not about destroying these forces but about understanding them so clearly that their magnetic pull loses its power over you.","goyandka":"This verse, the pivotal verse of Chapter 14, introduces the threefold framework that will be elaborated in the following verses. The technical precision is important: guṇas are 'strands' (the literal meaning) — they are not mere qualities but fundamental constituents of Prakṛti that, like three intertwined ropes, create the fabric of all phenomenal experience. The soul (dehin) is explicitly called 'avyayam' — indestructible and unchanging — to establish that bondage is not the soul's natural state. All subsequent teaching flows from this: if the soul is inherently free, then understanding what binds it is the direct path to liberation."}},{"verse":6,"sanskrit":"तत्र सत्त्वं निर्मलत्वात् प्रकाशकम् अनामयम् । सुख-सङ्गेन बध्नाति ज्ञान-सङ्गेन चानघ ॥","transliteration":"tatra sattvaṃ nirmalatvāt prakāśakam anāmayam | sukha-saṅgena badhnāti jñāna-saṅgena ca anagha ||","translation":"Among the three, sattva is pure, luminous, and free from suffering — it illumines the mind with clarity and joy.

But if we cling to these experiences, even they become golden chains. The sincere sādhaka must be willing to offer up even the sweetness of spiritual experience at the Lord's feet. True freedom is not the enjoyment of sattvic bliss; it is the freedom even from needing that bliss.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents the most subtle form of bondage — sattvic bondage. Sattva is 'nirmala' (pure), 'prakāśaka' (illuminating), 'anāmaya' (free from affliction) — it is the closest a conditioned state can come to the nature of the Ātman. But it still binds through saṅga: 'sukha-saṅga' (clinging to the experience of inner happiness) and 'jñāna-saṅga' (pride in spiritual knowledge). The Vedāntic student who is attached to the experience of clarity and wisdom has not yet crossed the final barrier. Even the love of enlightenment, if it generates clinging, is a subtle form of ego.","yogananda":"Sattva is heaven — but heaven is still not the Infinite. The sattvic meditator experiences genuine luminosity, genuine peace, genuine wisdom — and these are real gifts. But if the meditator becomes attached to these sattvic experiences, saying 'I am a spiritual person, I have wisdom, I experience deep peace,' they are still in the net of the guṇas. The final leap requires releasing even the most refined sattvic identity. As Yogananda put it: do not mistake the map for the territory, do not mistake even the highest spiritual experience for the Self that witnesses all experiences.","goyandka":"The description of sattva as 'nirmalatvāt prakāśakam anāmayam' establishes it as the highest of the three guṇas — it promotes clarity of mind, health of body, and receptivity to knowledge. However, 'badhnāti' is the crucial word: even sattva binds. 'Sukha-saṅga' refers to the attachment that forms around the experiences of inner tranquility and meditative joy — the seeker becomes reluctant to leave these states. 'Jñāna-saṅga' points to intellectual pride and the clinging to one's own spiritual understanding. Both are impediments to the guṇātīta state."}},{"verse":7,"sanskrit":"रजो रागात्मकं विद्धि तृष्णा-सङ्ग-समुद्भवम् । तन् निबध्नाति कौन्तेय कर्म-सङ्गेन देहिनम् ॥","transliteration":"rajaḥ rāgātmakaṃ viddhi tṛṣṇā-saṅga-samudbhavam | tat nibadhnāti kaunteya karma-saṅgena dehinam ||","translation":"Know rajas to be of the very nature of passion — born of deep craving and relentless attachment.

The Lord says its very nature (ātmakam) is rāga — passionate attachment. And from where does it arise? From 'tṛṣṇā' — thirst, the aching hunger for more — and from 'saṅga' — the stickiness that makes every desired object feel like it is a part of us. The rajasic person is never at rest. They bind themselves through 'karma-saṅga' — attachment to their own actions and their results. The antidote is not inaction but nishkāma karma — action offered freely, without the sticky hands of desire.","sarvapriyananda":"Rajas is described with great precision: 'rāgātmakam' — its very ātma, its essential nature, is rāga (passion, coloring, attraction). And its origin is 'tṛṣṇā-saṅga-samudbhavam' — born from the pairing of tṛṣṇā (craving) and saṅga (attachment). This is important: rajas does not arise from outside; it arises from within, from the movement of the mind toward desired objects. It binds through 'karma-saṅga' — the soul becomes enslaved to the cycle of action and result, always in motion, never coming to rest. The antidote is karma yoga: action without the kartṛtva-abhimāna (the sense of 'I am the doer').","yogananda":"Rajas is the engine of the world — the force that drives civilization, ambition, creativity, and restless human striving. In itself it is not evil; it is Prakṛti's great creative power. But when it governs the soul, it produces the most common human suffering: the exhausting treadmill of desire and fulfillment and new desire. 'Tṛṣṇā' — thirst — is the perfect word: like drinking salt water, rajasic fulfillment only intensifies the thirst. The soul enslaved to rajas is always chasing, never arriving. The way out is to discover the inner spring of joy that needs no outer object to sustain it.","goyandka":"The characterization 'rāgātmakam' is definitive: rajas is not merely accompanied by rāga but is constituted by it — passion is its very substance. 'Tṛṣṇā-saṅga-samudbhavam' identifies the two generative forces of rajas: tṛṣṇā (the craving for objects not yet obtained) and saṅga (the attachment to objects already obtained or familiar). Together these two create the rajasic condition. Binding occurs through 'karma-saṅga' — not karma itself (which is natural and unavoidable for an embodied being) but saṅga toward karma: the proprietary feeling of 'my actions, my achievements, my results.'"}},{"verse":8,"sanskrit":"तमस् त्व् अज्ञान-जं विद्धि मोहनं सर्व-देहिनाम् । प्रमादालस्य-निद्राभिस् तन् निबध्नाति भारत ॥","transliteration":"tamaḥ tu ajñāna-jaṃ viddhi mohanaṃ sarva-dehinām | pramāda-ālasya-nidrābhiḥ tat nibadhnāti bhārata ||","translation":"Tamas, born of ignorance, is the great deluder of all beings in embodied existence.

Notice: it deludes everyone, not just some. The Lord mentions pramāda first — carelessness, negligence, a kind of spiritual intoxication that makes one forget what is real and what is important. Then ālasya — the heaviness that says 'later, not now, what's the point.' And nidrā — sleep, not just physical sleep but the deeper sleep of unawareness in which most people spend their lives. The spiritual path begins with simply waking up from this deep tamасic sleep.","sarvapriyananda":"Tamas is the most foundational of the three guṇas because it is 'ajñāna-jam' — born of ignorance itself. Sattva illuminates, rajas agitates, tamas covers. Where sattva and rajas both involve some activity of the mind (pleasure, desire), tamas operates by suppressing mind-activity entirely through pramāda, ālasya, and nidrā. The word 'mohanam' is particularly significant in Vedānta — moha is not mere confusion but the fundamental delusion about the nature of the Self. Tamas is the grossest form of māyā's veiling power, the avaraṇa-śakti that hides the luminous Ātman most completely.","yogananda":"Tamas is the spiritual enemy that most people never recognize as an enemy — because it feels like peace, like rest, like 'just relaxing.' But there is a vast difference between the sattvic peace of conscious inner stillness and the tamasic stupor of unconscious inertia. The tamasic person is not resting; they are spiritually asleep. Pramāda (heedlessness) is tamas of the will; ālasya (laziness) is tamas of the body; nidrā (sleep) is tamas of the mind. Together they create a cocoon of unconsciousness that keeps the soul from ever beginning its journey back to the Light.","goyandka":"The contrast with sattva and rajas is marked by the particle 'tu' — 'but tamas.' Where sattva illuminates and rajas activates, tamas is 'ajñāna-jam' — its very birthplace is ignorance. This is the guṇa that does not merely misdirect the seeker (as rajas does) or create subtle attachment (as sattva does) but covers awareness itself. 'Mohanam sarva-dehinām' — it deludes all embodied beings, not just the spiritually immature. The three instruments of tamasic binding — pramāda, ālasya, nidrā — all operate by reducing or eliminating the sattvic light of discriminative awareness (viveka)."}},{"verse":9,"sanskrit":"सत्त्वं सुखे सञ्जयति रजः कर्मणि भारत । ज्ञानम् आवृत्य तु तमः प्रमादे सञ्जयत्य् उत ॥","transliteration":"sattvaṃ sukhe sañjayati rajaḥ karmaṇi bhārata | jñānam āvṛtya tu tamaḥ pramāde sañjayati uta ||","translation":"Sattva draws the Soul into attachment to inner happiness; rajas binds through attachment to outward action, O Arjuna.

And tamas first covers your knowledge — veils your discrimination — and then drops you into pramāda, that sleepy heedlessness where life slips by unexamined. Looking at your own life, which pull do you feel most strongly right now? The answer itself is a gift of self-knowledge that begins to loosen the guṇa's grip.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse provides the functional signatures of the three guṇas: their characteristic domains of attachment. 'Sañjayati' is a significant verb — it means to cause to cling, to affix, to bind with attachment. Sattva does not merely produce happiness; it produces attachment to happiness. Rajas does not merely produce activity; it produces attachment to activity. Tamas first performs a preliminary act — 'jñānam āvṛtya' (having covered knowledge) — and then attaches to pramāda. This preliminary covering is important: tamas must first destroy discriminative awareness before it can establish its binding. This is why the Gītā's first remedy for tamas is always viveka — awakening discrimination.","yogananda":"Each guṇa has its preferred domain where it hooks the soul. The sattvic soul is hooked by the beautiful experience of inner happiness — and there is nothing wrong with that happiness except the clinging. The rajasic soul is hooked by the thrill of doing and achieving. The tamasic soul is hooked by... nothing, by the absence of awareness itself, by the comfort of not-knowing and not-caring. The phrase 'jñānam āvṛtya' — having covered knowledge — is crucial: tamas does not offer you something enticing to be attached to; it simply removes the light of awareness so that heedlessness feels natural.","goyandka":"This verse is the practical summary of verses 6, 7, and 8. The verb 'sañjayati' (from the root sañj, to cling) specifies the mechanism of guṇa-bondage: each guṇa creates its characteristic attachment. Sattva → sukha-saṅga; rajas → karma-saṅga; tamas → pramāda-saṅga (after first covering jñāna). The sequence for tamas is notably different: 'jñānam āvṛtya tu tamaḥ pramāde sañjayati' — it first veils jñāna and then attaches to pramāda. This two-step mechanism (veil first, then bind) explains why the tamasic person is the hardest to awaken: they cannot even perceive that they are bound."}},{"verse":10,"sanskrit":"रजस् तमश् चाभिभूय सत्त्वं भवति भारत । रजः सत्त्वं तमश् चैव तमः सत्त्वं रजस् तथा ॥","transliteration":"rajaḥ tamaḥ ca abhibhūya sattvaṃ bhavati bhārata | rajaḥ sattvaṃ tamaḥ ca eva tamaḥ sattvaṃ rajaḥ tathā ||","translation":"At times sattva rises and prevails, overcoming rajas and tamas, O Arjuna.

The guṇas are not permanent prisons — they are flowing, shifting, competing forces. Sattva can overcome rajas and tamas. This means: no matter how deeply you are currently in the darkness of tamas or the frenzy of rajas, sattva can rise and overcome them. The path of sādhana — prayer, study, good company, wholesome food, early rising — is nothing other than the deliberate cultivation of sattva so that it wins the competition within you. And once sattva prevails long enough, you gain the discrimination to transcend even sattva itself and become guṇātīta.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse reveals the dynamic, processual nature of the guṇas. They are not static categories but living forces in constant interaction. 'Abhibhūya' — by overcoming, subduing, gaining dominance over. This is the language of competition. Each guṇa perpetually strives to dominate the other two. For the Vedāntic seeker, this teaching offers both a diagnostic tool (observe which guṇa is currently dominant in you) and a prescriptive tool (deliberately cultivate sattva through appropriate means to overcome rajas and tamas). The ultimate goal, however, as the next verses will reveal, is to transcend all three guṇas entirely — to become guṇātīta.","yogananda":"The guṇas are like three wrestlers constantly grappling with each other inside the arena of your body and mind. Right now, as you read this, one of the three is dominant — and the other two are waiting for their opportunity. This is not depressing news; it is deeply hopeful. Because it means that tamas never has the last word. Sattva can always rise. Even the most tamasic person, under the right conditions — the right teacher, the right practice, the right grace — can experience sattva breaking through like sunlight through clouds. The spiritual path is simply learning how to make sattva's victory more frequent, more stable, and ultimately permanent.","goyandka":"The verse establishes what later commentators call the 'guṇa-parināma-vāda' — the doctrine of continuous transformation among the guṇas. The three are always present but never in equal proportion; their proportions shift constantly, and whichever is dominant colors the consciousness of the embodied being at that moment. The practical implication for the sādhaka is clear: the current tamasic or rajasic state is not permanent and can be overcome. The prescribed method is the cultivation of sattvic conditions — sattvic diet, sattvic company (satsaṅga), sattvic study (svādhyāya), and regular practice — until sattva becomes the habitual dominant, creating the conditions for final guṇa-transcendence."}},{"verse":11,"sanskrit":"सर्व-द्वारेषु देहेऽस्मिन् प्रकाश उपजायते । ज्ञानं यदा तदा विद्याद् विवृद्धं सत्त्वम् इत्य् उत ॥","transliteration":"sarva-dvāreṣu dehe'smin prakāśa upajāyate | jñānaṃ yadā tadā vidyād vivṛddhaṃ sattvam ity uta ||","translation":"When the radiant light of wisdom shines through every gate of this body — through every sense, the mind, and the awakened intellect — one may know that blessed sattva has risen into predominance, filling the inner life with clarity and peace.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_11.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"सर्व-द्वारेषु","transliteration":"sarva-dvāreṣu","root":"sarva (all) + dvāra (door, gate, opening)","grammatical_form":"tatpuruṣa compound, locative plural, neuter","meaning":"through all gates (senses, mind, intellect)"},{"word":"देहे अस्मिन्","transliteration":"dehe asmin","root":"deha (body) + idam (this, demonstrative pronoun)","grammatical_form":"noun + demonstrative pronoun, locative singular, masculine/neuter","meaning":"in this body"},{"word":"प्रकाशः","transliteration":"prakāśaḥ","root":"kāś (to shine, to illuminate) with prefix pra-","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"light, luminosity, radiance"},{"word":"उपजायते","transliteration":"upajāyate","root":"jan (to be born) with prefix upa-","grammatical_form":"verb, third person singular, present tense, passive/ātmanepada","meaning":"arises, is born"},{"word":"ज्ञानम्","transliteration":"jñānam","root":"jñā (to know)","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, neuter","meaning":"knowledge, luminous awareness"},{"word":"यदा","transliteration":"yadā","root":"ya (relative pronoun base) — temporal adverb","grammatical_form":"indeclinable adverb (relative temporal)","meaning":"when"},{"word":"तदा","transliteration":"tadā","root":"tad (demonstrative pronoun base) — temporal adverb","grammatical_form":"indeclinable adverb (correlative temporal)","meaning":"then"},{"word":"विद्यात्","transliteration":"vidyāt","root":"vid (to know)","grammatical_form":"verb, third person singular, optative (potential mood), active, parasmaipada","meaning":"one should know, understand"},{"word":"विवृद्धम्","transliteration":"vivṛddham","root":"vṛdh (to grow, to increase) with prefix vi-","grammatical_form":"past passive participle, accusative singular, neuter","meaning":"increased, grown, predominant"},{"word":"सत्त्वम्","transliteration":"sattvam","root":"sat (being, truth, purity)","grammatical_form":"noun, accusative singular, neuter","meaning":"the quality of purity, clarity, goodness"},{"word":"इति उत","transliteration":"iti uta","root":"iti (quotative/enumerative particle) + uta (emphatic particle)","grammatical_form":"two indeclinable particles","meaning":"thus it is said, verily"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"When sattva rises in the heart, Beloved, it is like sunrise — every corner of the inner house is flooded with light.

'Prakāśa' (luminosity) and 'jñānam' (knowledge) jointly indicate the sattvic condition: the intellect functions without confusion, the mind is undisturbed, and the senses operate with restraint and clarity. This verse thus gives the practical method of self-assessment by guṇa-diagnosis."}},{"verse":12,"sanskrit":"लोभः प्रवृत्तिर् आरम्भः कर्मणाम् अशमः स्पृहा । रजस्य् एतानि जायन्ते विवृद्धे भरतर्षभ ॥","transliteration":"lobhaḥ pravṛttir ārambhaḥ karmaṇām aśamaḥ spṛhā | rajasy etāni jāyante vivṛddhe bharatarṣabha ||","translation":"When rajas surges into dominance, the signs are unmistakable: greed stirs in the heart, a fever of activity grips the mind, new projects are ceaselessly launched, inner stillness flees, and craving intensifies — O Best of the Bharatas, this restless tide is rajas revealed.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_12.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"लोभः","transliteration":"lobhaḥ","root":"lubh (to covet, to be greedy)","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"greed, acquisitiveness, covetousness"},{"word":"प्रवृत्तिः","transliteration":"pravṛttiḥ","root":"vṛt (to turn, to proceed) with prefix pra-","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, feminine","meaning":"outward activity, impulse toward action"},{"word":"आरम्भः","transliteration":"ārambhaḥ","root":"rabh (to seize, to begin) with prefix ā-","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"undertaking, initiation of new projects"},{"word":"कर्मणाम्","transliteration":"karmaṇām","root":"kṛ (to do, to act)","grammatical_form":"noun, genitive plural, neuter","meaning":"of actions, of works"},{"word":"अशमः","transliteration":"aśamaḥ","root":"a- (negation) + śam (to be calm, to be still)","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"restlessness, absence of stillness"},{"word":"स्पृहा","transliteration":"spṛhā","root":"spṛh (to desire earnestly, to long for)","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, feminine","meaning":"craving, longing, intense desire"},{"word":"रजसि","transliteration":"rajasi","root":"rañj (to colour, to be passionate)","grammatical_form":"noun, locative singular, neuter","meaning":"in rajas, when the quality of passion"},{"word":"एतानि","transliteration":"etāni","root":"etad (demonstrative pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"demonstrative pronoun, nominative plural, neuter","meaning":"these (five signs)"},{"word":"जायन्ते","transliteration":"jāyante","root":"jan (to be born, to arise)","grammatical_form":"verb, third person plural, present tense, passive/ātmanepada","meaning":"are born, arise"},{"word":"विवृद्धे","transliteration":"vivṛddhe","root":"vṛdh (to grow, to increase) with prefix vi-","grammatical_form":"past passive participle, locative singular, neuter (absolute construction)","meaning":"when increased, when predominant"},{"word":"भरतर्षभ","transliteration":"bharatarṣabha","root":"Bharata (dynasty name) + ṛṣabha (bull, best)","grammatical_form":"tatpuruṣa compound, vocative singular, masculine","meaning":"O Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna)"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"How well the Lord knows the restless heart! When rajas surges, the mind cannot sit still — it must plan the next project, acquire the next thing, always reaching forward into an imagined future. Lobha is not only greed for money but the subtle greed of wanting more experiences, more achievements, more recognition. Dear seeker, when you notice this feverish planning, this inability to be present, gently turn within and ask: am I being driven by rajas? That very noticing is the beginning of sattva.","sarvapriyananda":"Rajas is defined in the Sāṅkhya system as the principle of activity, kinetic energy, and agitation. These five signs — greed, activity, initiation, restlessness, craving — are not merely moral failures but diagnostic markers of Prakṛti's rajasic mode operating through the psycho-physical instrument. 'Aśama,' the absence of śama (mental quietude), is particularly significant for Advaita sādhana, since śama is the very first of the ṣaṭ-sampat (six virtues) prerequisite to Vedāntic inquiry. One cannot inquire into the nature of Brahman from within a rajasic mind — the instruments of knowledge are too agitated to reflect Awareness clearly.","yogananda":"Rajas is the cosmic force of vibration and manifestation — it is what makes the universe buzz and hum with incessant activity. In the human psyche this same force expresses as the driven quality of ego-ambition: always launching, always wanting, never resting in the fullness of the present. The five signs given here are like five windows through which rajas reveals itself. The spiritual aspirant learns to recognize them not with self-condemnation but with the calm gaze of the witness, then redirects that rajasic energy upward through pranayama, devotion, and selfless service — for transformed rajas becomes the dynamo of spiritual aspiration.","goyandka":"This verse catalogues the five characteristic modifications of a rajasically dominated antaḥkaraṇa (inner instrument). Lobha arises from identification with the body and its desires; pravṛtti is the consequent outward thrust of energy; ārambha is the proliferation of new undertakings as the rajasic will seeks fresh objects; aśama is the structural inability of the rajasic mind to achieve stillness; and spṛhā is the chronic background-craving that fuels the entire cycle. The Gītā's purpose in cataloguing these is not condemnation but discernment — for one who cannot recognize rajas cannot transcend it."}},{"verse":13,"sanskrit":"अप्रकाशोऽप्रवृत्तिश् च प्रमादो मोह एव च । तमस्य् एतानि जायन्ते विवृद्धे कुरु-नन्दन ॥","transliteration":"aprakāśo 'pravṛttiś ca pramādo moha eva ca | tamasy etāni jāyante vivṛddhe kuru-nandana ||","translation":"When tamas grows dominant, darkness descends upon the inner life: the light of discrimination fades, initiative and purposeful action vanish, careless heedlessness overtakes the mind, and delusion obscures all true understanding — O Joy of the Kurus, this spiritual fog is tamas at work.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_13.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अप्रकाशः","transliteration":"aprakāśaḥ","root":"a- (negation) + pra-kāś (to shine, to illumine)","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"absence of light, dullness, darkness of mind"},{"word":"अप्रवृत्तिः","transliteration":"apravṛttiḥ","root":"a- (negation) + pra-vṛt (to proceed, to be active)","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, feminine","meaning":"inactivity, inability to initiate"},{"word":"च","transliteration":"ca","root":"ca (enclitic conjunction)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable conjunction","meaning":"and"},{"word":"प्रमादः","transliteration":"pramādaḥ","root":"mad (to be heedless, intoxicated) with prefix pra-","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"heedlessness, negligence, forgetting duty"},{"word":"मोहः","transliteration":"mohaḥ","root":"muh (to be confused, to be deluded)","grammatical_form":"noun, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"delusion, confusion, inability to discriminate"},{"word":"एव","transliteration":"eva","root":"eva (emphatic particle)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable emphatic particle","meaning":"indeed, also"},{"word":"तमसि","transliteration":"tamasi","root":"tam (to be dark, to be inert)","grammatical_form":"noun, locative singular, neuter","meaning":"in tamas, when the quality of inertia"},{"word":"एतानि","transliteration":"etāni","root":"etad (demonstrative pronoun base)","grammatical_form":"demonstrative pronoun, nominative plural, neuter","meaning":"these (four signs)"},{"word":"जायन्ते","transliteration":"jāyante","root":"jan (to be born, to arise)","grammatical_form":"verb, third person plural, present tense, passive/ātmanepada","meaning":"arise, are produced"},{"word":"विवृद्धे","transliteration":"vivṛddhe","root":"vṛdh (to grow, to increase) with prefix vi-","grammatical_form":"past passive participle, locative singular, neuter (absolute construction)","meaning":"when increased, when predominant"},{"word":"कुरु-नन्दन","transliteration":"kuru-nandana","root":"Kuru (proper noun — dynastic name) + nand (to rejoice, to delight)","grammatical_form":"tatpuruṣa compound, vocative singular, masculine","meaning":"O Joy of the Kurus (Arjuna)"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Tamas is the heaviest of the Lord's veils, and it is cunning — for when we are under its sway we do not even know it. The tamasic mind feels no urgency to pray, no motivation to serve, no curiosity about truth. We sleep too long and still feel tired; we postpone what matters; we forget what is real. Yet even here, Beloved, the Lord does not abandon us. The very fact that you are reading these words suggests a spark of sattva still alive in you — fan that spark with morning prayer, sattvic food, and the company of the wise.","sarvapriyananda":"The four signs of tamas are all privatives — absences rather than positive qualities. Aprakāśa is the absence of the Ātman's luminosity at the level of the instruments; apravṛtti is the absence of constructive activity; pramāda is the absence of mindfulness (smṛti); and moha is the absence of viveka-śakti (discriminative power). Śaṅkara associates tamas with āvaraṇa-śakti — the veiling power of Māyā — which conceals the true nature of the Self. This is why tamas is the most dangerous guṇa for the spiritual seeker: it does not create visible suffering (as rajas does) but rather a numbing obscuration that makes the seeker forget that there is anything to seek.","yogananda":"Tamas is the cosmic principle of inertia, of matter at its densest, of consciousness at its most contracted. In the human being it manifests as spiritual torpor — the heavy, foggy, unmotivated state where even the desire for God seems remote and unreal. The meditating devotee will recognize these tamasic hours: the alarm rings and the body refuses; the meditation cushion collects dust; the scriptures seem dry and irrelevant. The antidote is not willpower alone but the company of truth — satsaṅga, chanting, selfless work — which introduces sattvic vibrations from outside until one's own inner fire is rekindled.","goyandka":"Where rajas produces excess activity, tamas produces its opposite — a fourfold paralysis of the inner instrument. Aprakāśa indicates that the buddhi (intellect) has lost its capacity for discrimination; apravṛtti shows that even legitimate duties are abandoned; pramāda is the careless neglect of scriptural injunctions and one's svadharma; and moha is the root confusion that takes the non-Self for the Self and the transient for the permanent. The Gītā consistently pairs pramāda and moha as the twin foundations of tamasic bondage, as seen also in verse 14.17. The sādhaka must be vigilant: tamas disguises itself as rest and contentment but is in fact the deepest spiritual sleep."}},{"verse":14,"sanskrit":"यदा सत्त्वे प्रवृद्धे तु प्रलयं याति देह-भृत् । तदोत्तम-विदां लोकान् अमलान् प्रतिपद्यते ॥","transliteration":"yadā sattve pravṛddhe tu pralayaṃ yāti deha-bhṛt | tadottama-vidāṃ lokān amalān pratipadyate ||","translation":"When the Soul passes from the body while sattva reigns within — in clarity, devotion, and inner light — it rises to the luminous realms where great sages dwell, the pure astral worlds of those who have known the highest Divine Truth.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_14.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यदा","transliteration":"yadā","root":"ya (relative pronoun base) — temporal adverb","grammatical_form":"indeclinable adverb (relative temporal)","meaning":"when, at the time that"},{"word":"सत्त्वे प्रवृद्धे","transliteration":"sattve pravṛddhe","root":"sat (being, purity) + pra-vṛdh (to grow, to increase)","grammatical_form":"noun + past passive participle, locative singular, neuter (locative absolute construction)","meaning":"when sattva is predominant, increased"},{"word":"तु","transliteration":"tu","root":"tu (contrastive/emphatic particle)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable particle","meaning":"indeed, but (mild emphasis)"},{"word":"प्रलयम्","transliteration":"pralayam","root":"lī (to dissolve, to merge) with prefix pra-","grammatical_form":"noun, accusative singular, masculine","meaning":"dissolution, death (of the body)"},{"word":"याति","transliteration":"yāti","root":"yā (to go, to travel, to attain)","grammatical_form":"verb, third person singular, present tense, active, parasmaipada","meaning":"goes, attains, reaches"},{"word":"देह-भृत्","transliteration":"deha-bhṛt","root":"deha (body) + bhṛ (to bear, to carry)","grammatical_form":"tatpuruṣa compound, nominative singular, masculine","meaning":"the bearer of the body, the embodied soul"},{"word":"तदा","transliteration":"tadā","root":"tad (demonstrative pronoun base) — temporal adverb","grammatical_form":"indeclinable adverb (correlative temporal)","meaning":"then"},{"word":"उत्तम-विदाम्","transliteration":"uttama-vidām","root":"ud (up) + tama (superlative) + vid (to know)","grammatical_form":"tatpuruṣa compound, genitive plural, masculine","meaning":"of those who know the highest; of the most knowledgeable"},{"word":"लोकान्","transliteration":"lokān","root":"lok (to see, to perceive) — or primary noun","grammatical_form":"noun, accusative plural, masculine","meaning":"worlds, realms, planes"},{"word":"अमलान्","transliteration":"amalān","root":"a- (negation) + mala (impurity, stain)","grammatical_form":"adjective, accusative plural, masculine","meaning":"pure, stainless, uncontaminated"},{"word":"प्रतिपद्यते","transliteration":"pratipadyate","root":"pad (to go, to attain) with prefix prati-","grammatical_form":"verb, third person singular, present tense, ātmanepada","meaning":"attains, reaches, is born into"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The moment of death is the great examination — and our entire life is the preparation.

This is why the great ones devoted their lives to sattva: pure food, pure thoughts, pure association. And Beloved, we need not wait for death — we can choose sattvic dying every evening in sleep, and sattvic rebirth every morning in prayer.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse introduces the Gītā's teaching on guṇa-dependent transmigration — the quality of consciousness at the moment of death (pralaya) determines the next field of experience. 'Uttama-vidāṃ lokāḥ' — the worlds of those with the highest knowledge — refers to the sattvic lokas of sages, ṛṣis, and devas. 'Amalān' — pure, free from rajasic and tamasic contamination. Vedānta notes that even these sattvic realms are within saṃsāra, not liberation itself; they are meritorious but temporary. True mokṣa requires transcending even sattva (guṇātīta, verse 20). Nevertheless, sattvic birth greatly accelerates the path toward final liberation.","yogananda":"At death, the soul carries with it the subtle tendencies — the saṃskāras — that the guṇas have built throughout the incarnation. The sattvic soul, having cultivated clarity and God-awareness, naturally gravitates toward realms of expanded consciousness — what might be called the astral heavens of the great masters and teachers. There, surrounded by souls of high vibration, the ascending soul continues its education in divine wisdom. The lesson for the living is urgent: every sattvic thought, every meditation, every act of selfless love is building the momentum that will carry you upward beyond death.","goyandka":"Śrī Bhagavān here presents the law of guṇa-determined transmigration in three verses (14-15). The sattvic at death attains uttama-vidāṃ lokān — the brahmaloka or similar realms associated with those of supreme knowledge — described as 'amalān' (free from the impurities of rajas and tamas). This accords with the Upaniṣadic teaching of devayāna, the path of light followed by those of accumulated spiritual merit. Importantly, 'uttama-vidāṃ' suggests not merely ethical sattvic living but genuine jñāna — those who have devoted their lives to Brahmavidyā achieve the highest sattvic post-mortem destinations."}},{"verse":15,"sanskrit":"रजसि प्रलयं गत्वा कर्म-सङ्गिषु जायते । तथा प्रलीनस् तमसि मूढ-योनिषु जायते ॥","transliteration":"rajasi pralayaṃ gatvā karma-saṅgiṣu jāyate | tathā pralīnas tamasi mūḍha-yoniṣu jāyate ||","translation":"The Soul that departs in the grip of rajas is reborn among those driven by attachment to restless action and its fruits.

'Mūḍha-yoniṣu' — births characterized by mūḍhatā (deluded consciousness) — includes animal births and tamasically conditioned human births where avidyā (ignorance of one's true nature) is most dense. The Gītā's soteriology here is stark: without deliberate cultivation of sattva and jñāna, the default momentum of unconscious living moves the soul toward denser forms of bondage.","yogananda":"Like a magnet draws iron filings, the predominant vibration of the soul at death draws it toward its vibrational match in the next incarnation. The rajasic soul — full of unfinished projects and ungratified desires — is born where it can continue that feverish activity. The tamasic soul — thick with delusion and spiritual sleep — descends into embodiments where consciousness is still more contracted. This cosmic law of vibrational affinity is not punishment but physics of the soul. Sri Yukteswar taught that human birth is the rare and precious turning-point where conscious spiritual effort becomes possible — waste not a single incarnation.","goyandka":"The verse presents the rajasic and tamasic outcomes in a single breath, which itself suggests their relative inferiority compared to the sattvic outcome described in verse 14. 'Karma-saṅgiṣu' — literally 'among the attached-to-action' — indicates that rajasic rebirth perpetuates the fundamental error of taking oneself to be the doer and owner of results. 'Mūḍha-yoniṣu' is understood by commentators to include tiryag-yoni (animal births) and lower human births defined by constitutional tamas.

Rajasic action yields duḥkha — not merely external suffering but the inner suffering of ungratified desire, which is the structural condition of the rajasic ego. Tamasic action yields ajñāna — the thickening of the veil of avidyā, which is the ultimate bondage in Advaita. The sequence tamas→ajñāna→avidyā is the downward spiral that mokṣa-sādhana must reverse.","yogananda":"Every action leaves a vibration in the subtle body — a saṃskāra — that becomes part of the harvest of future experience. The sattvic action, performed in love and clarity, builds a luminous aura around the soul that naturally attracts more light. The rajasic action, powered by self-seeking desire, may produce temporary pleasure but inevitably crashes into duḥkha — for all rajasic pleasures contain within them the seed of their own frustration. Most significant is the tamasic fruit: ajñāna, spiritual blindness. This is why great teachers consistently said: it is not our sins that bind us most deeply, but our spiritual laziness and indifference.","goyandka":"This verse operates at two levels. First, the immediate karmic fruit: sattvic karma yields purity and joy in this life; rajasic karma yields restless suffering; tamasic karma yields dullness and deepened ignorance.

'Āhuḥ' (they say, it is said) suggests this is received wisdom, confirmed by the ṛṣis across generations.

The seeker can use this verse as a real-time diagnostic instrument during sādhana.","yogananda":"The Gītā here penetrates to the psychological roots of spiritual progress and its obstacles. Jñāna arising from sattva is the soul's natural light, unobstructed — it is not acquired but revealed. Lobha from rajas is the ceaseless hunger of the ego, which Paramhansa Yogananda described as the 'outward-moving force' that perpetually seeks in the wrong direction. Pramāda, moha, and ajñāna from tamas constitute a nested hierarchy of spiritual blindness: first comes inattention, then confusion, then the settled darkness of ignorance. The meditator's daily self-examination should check: which of these three is arising right now? Then apply the appropriate remedy — pranayama for tamas, detachment for rajas, meditation for the deepening of sattvic jñāna.","goyandka":"This verse completes the triple analysis of guṇa-effects on the inner instrument. The precision is notable: sattva yields one great fruit — jñāna; rajas yields one characteristic blemish — lobha (here 'eva ca' emphasizing that greed is the quintessential rajasic product); tamas yields three progressively deeper afflictions — pramāda (carelessness), moha (delusion), and ajñāna (ignorance). The correspondence with verse 13 is exact: pramāda and moha appeared there as signs of tamas, and ajñāna is their natural culmination. The Gītā thus presents tamas as the guṇa most antithetical to liberation, for it directly obscures the jñāna that is the very means of mokṣa."}},{"verse":18,"sanskrit":"ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्व-स्था मध्ये तिष्ठन्ति राजसाः । जघन्य-गुण-वृत्ति-स्था अधो गच्छन्ति तामसाः ॥","transliteration":"ūrdhvaṃ gacchanti sattva-sthāḥ madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ | jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthāḥ adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ ||","translation":"Souls established in sattva ascend to higher planes of luminous existence.

Choose sattva now, Beloved, and you choose the upward path.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse provides the cosmological map of guṇa-determined transmigration in its most compressed form. 'Ūrdhvam' (upward) refers to the sattvic lokas — realms of increasing luminosity, from svarga to brahmaloka. 'Madhye' (in the middle) is the human realm — the domain of rajas — where action, effort, and choice remain possible. 'Adhaḥ' (downward) refers to the tamasic planes, from lower human births to the tiryag-yoni (animal and plant kingdoms). For Advaita, however, this entire vertical cosmology is within Māyā. The liberated one — the guṇātīta — is not reborn anywhere in this structure but realizes their identity with nirguṇa Brahman, which is neither ūrdhva nor adhaḥ but ever free.","yogananda":"Sri Yukteswar explained in The Holy Science that the cosmos is organized as concentrically ascending spheres of consciousness — from the grossly material at the circumference to the purely spiritual at the center. The Gītā's vertical map (up-middle-down) expresses this same truth: the soul's guṇic tendency determines its trajectory through these spheres of experience. The sattvic soul moves centripetally toward the Source; the rajasic soul orbits in the middle distance of human activity; the tamasic soul moves centrifugally toward greater density and contraction. Meditation is the technology for reversing the outward drift and entering the upward current.","goyandka":"The compound 'jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthāḥ' deserves attention: 'jaghanya' means 'most vile, lowest, most base'; 'guṇa-vṛtti' means 'the modifications or tendencies of the guṇa'; 'sthāḥ' means 'established in'. Thus: those whose very constitution is organized around the lowest quality-tendencies. This is not merely situational tamas but characterological tamas — where the darkness has become the stable orientation of the soul. The contrast with 'sattva-sthāḥ' (established in sattva) is exact and deliberate: both groups have made their guṇa a settled abiding, not merely a passing state.

First: I am not the doer. The guṇas do all. The body acts, the mind reacts, but the witnessing Self — the draṣṭā — is untouched, unstained, forever free. Second: I am not even the guṇas. I am that which is beyond — the Puruṣa, the pure Consciousness, which is nothing other than the Lord Himself. 'Mad-bhāvaṃ so'dhigacchati' — he attains My very nature. What a promise. What a grace. The Lord says: see this, know this, and you become what you already are.","sarvapriyananda":"This is one of the most pivotal verses in the Gītā's guṇa-teaching and a cornerstone of Advaita Vedānta. It presents the two-fold liberating insight: (1) 'Nānyaṃ guṇebhyaḥ kartāraṃ' — the recognition that all apparent action belongs to Prakṛti's guṇas, not to the Puruṣa/Ātman, which is akartā (non-doer) by nature. This is the dissolution of ahaṅkāra-kartṛtva, ego-doership. (2) 'Guṇebhyaś ca paraṃ vetti' — the recognition that Ātman/Brahman transcends the guṇa-realm entirely. The first recognition removes false attribution; the second reveals the positive truth. Together they produce 'mad-bhāva' — identity with the Lord's own nature, which for Advaita is Sat-Cit-Ānanda.","yogananda":"The great secret of non-doership — ahaṅkāra-nāśa — is revealed here with crystalline clarity. As long as we identify with body, mind, and ego, we believe ourselves to be the actors in life's drama. But the one who has learned to abide as the draṣṭā — the pure witness — sees the entire spectacle of the three guṇas playing out in Prakṛti, and recognizes the Self as their silent, uninvolved witness. Then the second realization: even the witness-position is transcended, and one knows the 'param' — that which is beyond all guṇas, beyond even witnessing — the very Self of the Lord. This is the samādhi of non-dual recognition. 'He attains My nature' — becomes one with the Infinite.","goyandka":"Verse 19 is the philosophical climax of the guṇa chapter. Two conditions must be simultaneously fulfilled for liberation: (a) the intellectual-experiential recognition that the guṇas alone are the agents in all Prakṛti-conditioned activity, thus dissolving the error of kartṛtva (doer-ship); and (b) the jñāna of 'guṇebhyaś ca param' — the direct knowledge of Puruṣa/Brahman as categorically beyond the guṇa-field. The word 'draṣṭā' (seer) is significant: not merely one who intellectually understands but one who directly perceives — a reference to aparokṣa-jñāna, direct/immediate knowledge.

This is essential: the Gītā does not say transcend tamas and rajas and rest in sattva.

'Deha-samudbhavān' — which have given rise to the body: the guṇas are the very cause of embodiment (saṃsāra), so transcending them is identical with transcending the birth-death cycle.

'Amṛtam aśnute' — one tastes amṛta, the nectar of immortality. This is the state of the great masters, liberated in life, to whom death is merely a change of costume. Every step toward transcending the guṇas — every meditation, every act of surrender, every moment of pure love — is a sip of that immortal nectar.","goyandka":"This verse serves as the conclusion of the guṇa-svarūpa section (verses 5-20) and the gateway to the guṇātīta section (verses 21-27). 'Deha-samudbhavān' — which have given rise to the body — identifies the guṇas as the proximate cause of physical embodiment: it is the interplay of sattva, rajas, and tamas in Prakṛti that generates the conditions for jīva's taking a body. Transcending them therefore means escaping the entire mechanism of saṃsāra. The fourfold list of liberated conditions — freedom from janma, mṛtyu, jarā, and duḥkha — echoes the four noble themes of Buddhist thought and points to a pan-Indian recognition of these as the fundamental afflictions of conditioned existence.

This is not suppression of experience but a profound disidentification from it — the one who watches the guṇas arise and subside without grasping or recoiling has found the Self that the guṇas cannot touch.","goyandka":"This first characteristic of the guṇātīta addresses the root cause of bondage: dvandva-moha, the delusion produced by pairs of opposites. By specifying all three guṇas — sattva (prakāśa), rajas (pravṛtti), and tamas (moha) — the Lord indicates that even the desirable quality of sattva is not to be clung to, and even tamas is not to be actively resisted. The sage transcends the entire guṇa-triad by the consistent practice of the witness attitude. Na dveṣṭi … na kāṅkṣati — freedom from both repulsion and attraction constitutes the primary external mark."}},{"verse":23,"sanskrit":"उदासीनवद् आसीनो गुणैर् यो न विचाल्यते । गुणा वर्तन्त इत्य् एवं योऽवतिष्ठति नेङ्गते ॥","transliteration":"udāsīnavad āsīnaḥ guṇaiḥ yaḥ na vicālyate | guṇāḥ vartante iti evaṃ yaḥ avatiṣṭhati na iṅgate ||","translation":"Abiding as a serene, uninvolved witness, undisturbed as the guṇas play out their dance — firmly grounded in the inner knowing that 'it is the guṇas that are moving, not I' — this liberated sage stands unshaken, unmoved by Nature's ever-turning wheel.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_23.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"उदासीनवत्","transliteration":"udāsīnavat","root":"ud + ā + √as (to sit; udāsīna = one who sits apart, an uninvolved witness)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable comparative adverb (vat suffix = like, as)","meaning":"like one who is uninvolved, as if indifferent; ud + āsīna — a crucial qualifier: 'like' an indifferent witness, not actually detached from compassion"},{"word":"आसीनः","transliteration":"āsīnaḥ","root":"ā + √as (to sit, to be seated, to abide)","grammatical_form":"masculine present participle (passive/middle), nominative singular","meaning":"seated, abiding, resting; present participle of ā + √as (to sit, to be) — suggesting a stable, grounded state"},{"word":"गुणैः","transliteration":"guṇaiḥ","root":"guṇa (strand, quality, attribute of Prakṛti)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun, instrumental plural","meaning":"by the guṇas; instrumental case — the guṇas as agents that attempt to move one"},{"word":"यः","transliteration":"yaḥ","root":"yad (relative pronoun: who, which)","grammatical_form":"masculine relative pronoun, nominative singular","meaning":"who; relative pronoun — the one being described"},{"word":"न विचाल्यते","transliteration":"na vicālyate","root":"na (negation) + vi + √cal (to be moved, to be agitated)","grammatical_form":"na: indeclinable; vicālyate: verb, passive voice, present tense, 3rd person singular","meaning":"is not disturbed, is not moved; na + vi + √cal — not agitated or shaken from one's center"},{"word":"गुणाः वर्तन्ते","transliteration":"guṇāḥ vartante","root":"guṇa (quality) + √vṛt (to move, to act, to function)","grammatical_form":"guṇāḥ: masculine noun, nominative plural; vartante: verb, ātmanepada, present tense, 3rd person plural","meaning":"the guṇas are moving, the guṇas are acting; the liberating cognitive shift — 'not I, but the guṇas'"},{"word":"इति","transliteration":"iti","root":"iti (particle of quotation and conclusion: thus, so)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable quotation marker","meaning":"thus, so; marks a quoted thought — the specific inner knowing of the guṇātīta"},{"word":"एवम्","transliteration":"evaṃ","root":"evam (demonstrative manner adverb: thus, in this way)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable adverb","meaning":"thus, in this way; emphasizing the particular understanding 'the guṇas move, not I'"},{"word":"अवतिष्ठति","transliteration":"avatiṣṭhati","root":"ava + √sthā (to stand firm, to remain established)","grammatical_form":"verb, parasmaipada, present tense, 3rd person singular","meaning":"remains established, stands firm; ava + √sthā — to be firmly grounded in one's nature"},{"word":"न इङ्गते","transliteration":"na iṅgate","root":"na (negation) + √iṅg (to stir, to move slightly)","grammatical_form":"na: indeclinable; iṅgate: verb, ātmanepada, present tense, 3rd person singular","meaning":"does not move, is not stirred; na + iṅg (to stir, to be moved) — emphasizing motionlessness of the Self"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Here the Lord gives us the inner secret of the guṇātīta's freedom — his constant, quiet inner knowing: 'the guṇas are moving, not I.' This one recognition changes everything. Like a man sitting beside a rushing river, he watches the water flow past without being swept away. The word udāsīnavat — 'as if uninvolved' — is so gentle and wise; the sage is fully present in the world, fully alive to all that happens, yet something in him stands apart like the still sky above all weather.

The sage constantly cognizes: 'I am the changeless witness; the changing belongs to Prakṛti.' Udāsīnavat does not mean cold indifference — it means non-identification. He is present, aware, compassionate — but unmistaken about who is the seer and what is seen.","yogananda":"The sage described here has achieved what the yogis call Sākṣī-bhāva — the state of the pure witness. He is not detached from life in a cold or withdrawn sense; rather, he participates fully while remaining inwardly steady, like a deep ocean that sends waves to the shore without its depths being disturbed. 'The guṇas are moving' — this is his internal mantra, his constant recognition. Whenever the mind grows bright with sattva or turbulent with rajas or clouded with tamas, he does not say 'I am illumined' or 'I am agitated' — he says simply, 'the guṇas are at work,' and rests in that witnessing presence.","goyandka":"This verse provides the epistemological basis for guṇātītatva: viveka — discriminative knowledge regarding the self and the guṇas. 'Na vicālyate' and 'na iṅgate' together stress that the guṇātīta's equanimity is not occasional but continuous; he is never destabilized from his center. The expression 'guṇā vartante iti evaṃ avatiṣṭhati' is technically important: this is the pratyaya (cognition) of the liberated being — a stable, moment-to-moment recognition that all movement and modification belong to Prakṛti.

The most beautiful is 'sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ': the sage sees a lump of mud and a nugget of gold and feels the same quiet regard for both. Not because he is dull or indifferent, but because his heart has been filled with something that makes all earthly things transparent — he sees through them to the one Reality that shines equally in all. And 'sva-sthaḥ' — standing in his own Self — is the key to all the rest. When we truly rest in the Self, what can touch us?","sarvapriyananda":"The verse presents six paired equalities, each representing the dissolution of a layer of identification. 'Sva-sthaḥ' is the most technically precise: the one who is 'standing in the Self' has shifted his locus of identity from the body-mind complex (which receives pleasure, pain, praise, blame) to the Ātman (which is untouched by all modifications). 'Sama-loṣṭāśma-kāñcanaḥ' is the classical Vedāntic illustration of seeing Brahman equally in all forms — when the gold of Self is recognized as the one substrate, the apparent hierarchy of dust, stone, and gold collapses. This is not insensitivity but the deepest kind of vision.","yogananda":"The sage depicted here has undergone a profound internal transformation: the scales by which he once measured life — more pleasure, less pain; more gold, less mud; more praise, less blame — have dissolved. This is not achieved by suppressing preferences but by contacting a joy so vast within that external comparisons lose their compulsive grip. 'Sva-sthaḥ' — standing in oneself — is the metaphor of the spiritual life perfectly captured in one Sanskrit word: the journey is inward, not outward, and when we find our home within, all the world becomes equally luminous and equally loved.","goyandka":"This verse lists six practical characteristics of the guṇātīta: (1) equanimity in sukha-duḥkha, (2) being sva-sthaḥ — abiding in the ātman, (3) equanimity toward loṣṭa-aśma-kāñcana (objects of varying worldly value), (4) equanimity toward priya and apriya (persons or experiences), (5) dhīratā — steady wisdom, (6) equanimity toward nindā and saṃstuti (blame and praise). Notably, sva-sthaḥ is placed at the center of the list as the root of all the others: all outer equanimity flows from inner abidance in the Self. Dhīraḥ here carries the specific Vedāntic connotation of one who has firm śruti-based understanding."}},{"verse":25,"sanskrit":"मानापमानयोस् तुल्यस् तुल्यो मित्रारि-पक्षयोः । सर्वारम्भ-परित्यागी गुणातीतः स उच्यते ॥","transliteration":"māna-apamānayoḥ tulyaḥ tulyaḥ mitra-ari-pakṣayoḥ | sarva-ārambha-parityāgī guṇātītaḥ saḥ ucyate ||","translation":"Equal in the face of honor and dishonor, holding friend and foe in the same compassionate regard, and having surrendered all personally-driven undertakings to the Divine Will — such a soul is called guṇātīta: one who has transcended the three qualities of Nature.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_25.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"मान","transliteration":"māna","root":"√man (to think, to regard; māna = honor, respect derived from how one is regarded)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun, prior member of dvandva compound (māna-apamānayoḥ)","meaning":"honor, respect, esteem; the pleasant face of social regard — what the ego loves to receive"},{"word":"अपमानयोः","transliteration":"apamānayoḥ","root":"apa (away, diminishing) + √man (to think; apamāna = dis-honor, disrespect)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun, genitive dual (completing the dvandva compound with māna)","meaning":"in dishonor, in disrespect; apa + māna — the reversal of esteem; genitive dual with māna"},{"word":"तुल्यः","transliteration":"tulyaḥ","root":"tulā (balance scale; equality, equivalence)","grammatical_form":"masculine adjective, nominative singular","meaning":"equal, the same; tulā = balance scale — he holds honor and dishonor on perfectly balanced scales"},{"word":"मित्र","transliteration":"mitra","root":"mitra (friend, ally; perhaps from √mid, to be unctuous, to befriend)","grammatical_form":"masculine/neuter noun, prior member of dvandva compound (mitra-ari-pakṣayoḥ)","meaning":"friend, ally; one who is disposed favorably toward the sage"},{"word":"अरि","transliteration":"ari","root":"ari (enemy, foe; from √ṛ, to go against)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun, medial member of compound","meaning":"enemy, opponent; ari = one who acts against — yet the sage is equal to both"},{"word":"पक्षयोः","transliteration":"pakṣayoḥ","root":"pakṣa (side, flank, faction; from √pakṣ, to take sides)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun, genitive dual","meaning":"in the two sides, toward both parties; pakṣa = side, faction — the two camps are equal to the guṇātīta"},{"word":"सर्व-आरम्भ","transliteration":"sarva-ārambha","root":"sarva (all, every) + ā + √rabh (to undertake, to begin; ārambha = beginning, initiation)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun compound, prior member of tatpuruṣa with parityāgī","meaning":"all beginnings, all undertakings, all self-initiated projects; ā + √rambh = to undertake, to start"},{"word":"परित्यागी","transliteration":"parityāgī","root":"pari + √tyaj (to abandon, to relinquish completely; parityāga = complete renunciation)","grammatical_form":"masculine agent noun (ṇini suffix), nominative singular","meaning":"one who has renounced, abandoned; pari + √tyaj — not that he does nothing, but he has no personal agenda driving his actions"},{"word":"गुणातीतः","transliteration":"guṇātītaḥ","root":"guṇa (quality, strand of Prakṛti) + ati + √i (to go beyond; atīta = transcended)","grammatical_form":"masculine bahuvrīhi/tatpuruṣa compound, nominative singular","meaning":"one who has transcended the guṇas; the formal compound: guṇa + atīta (past participle of ati + √i, to go beyond)"},{"word":"सः उच्यते","transliteration":"saḥ ucyate","root":"tad (demonstrative pronoun) + √vac (to speak; ucyate = is said, is called, passive form)","grammatical_form":"saḥ: masculine pronoun, nominative singular; ucyate: verb, passive voice, present tense, 3rd person singular","meaning":"he is said to be, he is called; ucyate = passive of √vac — this is the formal śāstric definition"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The Lord closes the portrait of the guṇātīta with 'sarvārambha-parityāgī' — the renouncer of all personal projects. This is so profound: the sage may be intensely active in the world, yet in his heart he has no personal agenda; everything he does is God's work flowing through him. He does not start anything for himself. And then comes the formal declaration: 'sa guṇātītaḥ ucyate' — he is called one who has gone beyond the guṇas. What a grace-filled word 'ucyate' is — it is said, it is acknowledged, it is recognized. The world eventually sees the freedom in such a soul, and that recognition itself becomes an instrument of blessing.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse climaxes with 'sarvārambha-parityāgī,' which from a Vedāntic standpoint points to the disappearance of ahaṃkāra — the I-sense that initiates action for personal fruition. In Advaita, karma accrues only when action flows from the false identification with the ego-agent; the guṇātīta, having seen through this falseness, neither accumulates nor is bound by karma. 'Sa guṇātītaḥ ucyate' is the śāstric definition (lakṣaṇa), formally closing Arjuna's first question. Verses 22–25 together enumerate ten qualities — a comprehensive and authoritative list of the liberated person's natural attributes.","yogananda":"The sage is equal toward friend and foe — not because he has become cold or indifferent, but because he has discovered a love so unconditional that it no longer requires the categories of 'mine' and 'other.' And sarvārambha-parityāgī — the renouncer of all undertakings — does not mean the sage sits idle; it means he never acts from the trembling center of the ego's need to accomplish, to be seen, to secure. His activity is the effortless expression of divine will, like the sun that shines without purpose yet illumines all. This is the freedom that lies at the heart of all genuine spiritual life.","goyandka":"With 'sarvārambha-parityāgī,' the Lord brings in a quality that belongs both to the mark (liṅga) and to the conduct (ācāra) of the guṇātīta. Ārambha means any undertaking initiated by personal desire (kāmya-karma); the guṇātīta has no kāma-driven agenda and therefore no personal ārambha. This does not preclude action — it precludes only self-motivated action. The formal conclusion 'guṇātītaḥ sa ucyate' employs the passive 'ucyate' (is called, is recognized as) because this is a śāstric pratyabhijñā — a recognition or identification formula used in defining a philosophical category."}},{"verse":26,"sanskrit":"मां च योऽव्यभिचारेण भक्ति-योगेन सेवते । स गुणान् समतीत्यैतान् ब्रह्म-भूयाय कल्पते ॥","transliteration":"mām ca yaḥ avyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena sevate | saḥ guṇān samatītya etān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate ||","translation":"And the devotee who worships Me with unwavering, undivided love through the yoga of devotion — offering the whole heart without straying — that soul, having transcended all three guṇas, becomes fully prepared and ripe for the supreme state of Brahman.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch14/verse_14_26.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"माम्","transliteration":"māṃ","root":"mad / asmad (first person pronoun: I, me)","grammatical_form":"first person pronoun, accusative singular","meaning":"Me (accusative); Krishna speaking — the personal God as the direct object of bhakti"},{"word":"च","transliteration":"ca","root":"ca (copulative/conjunctive particle: and, also)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable particle","meaning":"and; connecting this verse to the marks described in v22-25 — here comes the answer to 'how?'"},{"word":"यः","transliteration":"yaḥ","root":"yad (relative pronoun: who, which)","grammatical_form":"masculine relative pronoun, nominative singular","meaning":"who; relative pronoun introducing the one who practices avyabhicāra bhakti"},{"word":"अव्यभिचारेण","transliteration":"avyabhicāreṇa","root":"a (not) + vi + abhi + √car (to stray, to deviate; vyabhicāra = deviation, infidelity)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun (with negating prefix), instrumental singular","meaning":"without deviation, without wavering, exclusively; a + vi + abhi + √car — not straying to any other support or object; the same as ananya bhakti"},{"word":"भक्ति-योगेन","transliteration":"bhakti-yogena","root":"√bhaj (to share in, to be devoted to; bhakti = devotion) + √yuj (to yoke, to unite; yoga = discipline, union)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun compound, instrumental singular","meaning":"by the yoga of devotion; the instrumental case — bhakti (loving devotion) as the direct means of transcendence"},{"word":"सेवते","transliteration":"sevate","root":"√sev (to serve, to worship, to be devoted to)","grammatical_form":"verb, ātmanepada, present tense, 3rd person singular","meaning":"serves, worships, attends; √sev — to serve with love, to be devoted to; implies both inner worship and outer service"},{"word":"सः","transliteration":"saḥ","root":"tad (demonstrative pronoun: he, she, it)","grammatical_form":"masculine demonstrative pronoun, nominative singular","meaning":"he; the subject — the avyabhicāra-bhakta"},{"word":"गुणान्","transliteration":"guṇān","root":"guṇa (strand, quality, attribute of Prakṛti)","grammatical_form":"masculine noun, accusative plural","meaning":"the guṇas; accusative plural — what is transcended"},{"word":"समतीत्य","transliteration":"samatītya","root":"sam + ati + √i (to go completely beyond, to fully transcend)","grammatical_form":"indeclinable gerund (absolutive/ktvā form with prefix saṃ)","meaning":"having completely transcended; sam + ati + √i — an absolutive (gerund) indicating prior completion before becoming Brahman"},{"word":"एतान्","transliteration":"etān","root":"etad (this, these; proximate demonstrative pronoun)","grammatical_form":"masculine demonstrative pronoun, accusative plural","meaning":"these; referring to the specific three guṇas of this chapter"},{"word":"ब्रह्म-भूयाय","transliteration":"brahma-bhūyāya","root":"brahman (the Absolute) + √bhū (to become, to be; bhūya = becoming, being)","grammatical_form":"neuter noun compound, dative singular (expressing purpose: 'for the becoming of Brahman')","meaning":"for becoming Brahman, to attain Brahman-state; brahma + bhūya (becoming) + dative suffix — qualified for the state of being Brahman"},{"word":"कल्पते","transliteration":"kalpate","root":"√kḷp (to be fit for, to be capable of, to be competent)","grammatical_form":"verb, ātmanepada, present tense, 3rd person singular","meaning":"is fit for, becomes qualified for; √kḷp — to be capable of, to be suited for; a strong positive assertion of the bhakta's qualification"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse is the Lord's direct answer to Arjuna's third question — how does one transcend the guṇas? And Krishna's answer is so characteristic of His grace: through avyabhicāra bhakti, unwavering loving service to Me. Not through heroic austerity or complicated metaphysics, but through the heart's unbroken turning toward the Lord. This is what makes the Gita such a gift to all humanity. The one who loves God without wavering — who keeps returning to God through every mood, every season, every guṇa — that soul becomes fit for Brahman itself. Bhakti is not the lesser path; it is the path that makes all paths possible.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is theologically pivotal. The Advaita commentators note a subtle but important point: bhakti here is avyabhicāra — non-deviant, exclusive. The Advaitin reads this as upāsana progressing toward jñāna: the bhakta who keeps his mind unswervingly on the personal Lord becomes progressively purified until the final recognition that the worshiper and the worshiped are one. 'Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate' — becomes fit for the state of Brahman — speaks of an inner qualification, a purification of the antaḥkaraṇa, which then allows jñāna to dawn. Bhakti and jñāna are thus not rivals but stages on the same path.","yogananda":"Here Krishna reveals the master key: unwavering devotion. The great secret is that love is stronger than the guṇas. The guṇas bind through attraction and repulsion, through the oscillation between craving and aversion. But a heart that has found its rest in the Infinite Love of God has no room left for the guṇas to grip. Avyabhicāra bhakti — devotion that does not stray, does not divide its loyalty, does not seek its fulfillment in any lesser thing — this is the invincible force that carries the soul effortlessly across the entire field of the three guṇas into the boundless freedom of Brahman.","goyandka":"This verse answers the third part of Arjuna's question: the upāya (means) of guṇa-transcendence is avyabhicāra bhakti-yoga — the practice of undivided devotion to the Lord. Avyabhicāra means literally 'without straying to another' — the same concept as ananya-bhakti in 9.22. The Lord does not prescribe any specific guṇa-by-guṇa management technique; instead, total surrender to the Lord automatically produces guṇa-transcendence as a byproduct.

What an extraordinary declaration! Even the great impersonal Absolute — Brahman — rests in Me. Immortality rests in Me. The eternal dharma that holds all worlds in order rests in Me. And that unswerving, unconditional bliss that every soul ultimately seeks — that too rests in Me. The chapter that began with the binding power of the three guṇas ends here, in the most luminous way possible: beyond the guṇas, beyond Prakṛti, beyond even Brahman as an abstract concept, there is this — a living, loving Lord who is the ground of everything. When we rest in Him through avyabhicāra bhakti, we are resting in the foundation of all foundations. This is the great invitation of the Gita.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is among the most philosophically daring in the entire Bhagavad Gita, and it requires careful Vedāntic handling. Śaṅkarācārya interprets 'brahmaṇo pratiṣṭhā aham' as stating that the Nirguṇa Brahman, when approached through the lens of Māyā and upāsana, is ultimately grounded in Cit — pure Consciousness — which manifests through the saguna form of Krishna as the supreme Āśraya (support). Rāmānuja reads it more directly: the personal Lord is higher than the impersonal Brahman because Brahman is His body. Either way, the verse performs a stunning move: it takes the highest abstraction (Brahman) and reveals that even it has a foundation — the personal, loving, present God who speaks these words. Amṛta, avyaya, śāśvata dharma, and aikāntika sukha — all five realities cited have their ground in this one living source.","yogananda":"This verse is the mountaintop of the fourteenth chapter — and among the highest peaks of the entire Gita. The mystic understands it as the declaration that all spiritual experience ultimately points beyond itself to its source. When a seeker tastes immortality in deep meditation, it is because they have momentarily touched the hem of Krishna's infinite Being. When the dharma of righteousness feels absolutely compelling and universal, it is because it flows from this inexhaustible source. And aikāntika sukha — the bliss that has only one direction, that does not lean back toward fear — this is the bliss of the Self, of God, of the Beloved who is the very ground of all being. Let us love Him, serve Him, remember Him — for in Him we find not only liberation but the infinite joy that is our truest nature.","goyandka":"This concluding verse establishes the metaphysical hierarchy that underlies the entire chapter. The Lord states His supremacy over Brahman through the concept of pratiṣṭhā — not that Brahman is false or secondary in an ordinary sense, but that Brahman derives its ultimacy from Bhagavān Himself. The five attributes listed — Brahman, amṛtatva (immortality), avyayatva (imperishability), śāśvata dharma (eternal righteousness), and aikāntika sukha (absolute bliss) — are the five highest values sought by different schools of philosophy and different types of sādhaka. By claiming to be the pratiṣṭhā (foundation) of all five, the Lord synthesizes all spiritual aspirations into one supreme refuge. The practical implication is direct: the sādhaka who seeks any of these supreme values must ultimately come to bhakti of the personal Lord, as stated in verse 26. Verse 27 is thus not merely a theological statement — it is the definitive justification for the bhakti-yoga taught throughout the Gita."}}]`),t={chapter:14,verses:a};export{e as chapter,t as default,a as verses};
