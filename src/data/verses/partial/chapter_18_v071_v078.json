      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "The Lord's mercy knows no boundary — not even the boundary of full practice or deep study. The word 'api' — 'even' — is the hinge of this verse. Even one who merely hears with a quiet, unprejudiced heart participates in the liberation this scripture brings. Dadaji often said that the Gita is not a book to be understood all at once; it is a presence to be received. The condition is not comprehension but orientation: śraddhā (faith) and anasūyā (the absence of fault-finding). When the heart is open and non-critical, the teaching enters like light through an open window. One need not be a scholar, need not be a practitioner — the mere sincere listener is drawn toward the luminous worlds. This is the democratizing grace of the Gita: it includes everyone who comes with a willing heart.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda notes the crucial pairing of śraddhā and anasūyā as the twin conditions for genuine reception of scripture. Śraddhā is not blind belief — it is the readiness to receive, the posture of openness before what is greater than oneself. Anasūyā is even more subtle: it is the absence of the intellectual pride that finds fault in order to avoid transformation. The critic who listens only to refute cannot receive; the doubter who listens without pretense can. 'Api' — even — signals that the Gita's grace reaches the sincere listener just as surely as the devoted practitioner. The liberation promised here (muktaḥ) and the worlds attained (puṇya-karmaṇām) may be gradual, but they are real. The Gita does not exclude the humble beginner who simply listens with a clean heart.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw in this verse a profound statement about the law of spiritual receptivity. The Gita's teaching vibrates at the frequency of the Infinite, and whoever tunes into that frequency — even through simple, faithful listening — becomes entrained with liberation itself. Anasūyā, the absence of envy and caviling, is the removal of static from the receiver. The soul that listens to the Gita without the noise of ego-defence, without the chatter of intellectual resistance, begins to absorb its vibration directly. Yogananda emphasized that every sincere hearing of the Gita is a sowing in the soul — and those seeds will bear fruit. The 'auspicious worlds of the virtuous' represent both inner states of expanded consciousness and outer conditions of grace that the receptive listener naturally moves toward.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Goyandkaji explains that this verse establishes the supreme accessibility of the Gita's fruit. The four levels of relationship to this teaching — teaching it (v68), studying it (v70), hearing it (v71), and receiving it with one-pointed attention (v72) — all carry liberation. Even the most casual sincere listener is not excluded. Goyandkaji stressed that 'anasūyaḥ' is the practical qualifier: one must hear without the corrosive acid of fault-finding, which dissolves the teaching before it can nourish. The 'auspicious worlds' (śubhān lokān) of the virtuous are not merely post-mortem destinations but states of being available to the one who truly receives this knowledge. The Gita's grace is proportional to the purity of reception, not to the sophistication of the recipient."

        "dadaji": "After eighteen chapters of the most profound teaching ever spoken, the Lord does not declare victory — He asks two questions. This is the tenderness of the true Teacher. 'Kaccit' — has it reached you? Not: 'I have taught you everything, now go.' But: 'Have you received it? Has the darkness lifted?' The Lord's concern is not with His own teaching but with Arjuna's transformation. Dadaji noted that the verse opens and closes the Gita's central arc: the word 'sammoha' (confusion, bewilderment) echoes the state Arjuna was in at the very beginning — saṃmūḍha-chetāḥ in Chapter 2, verse 1. The Gita opened with a man stupefied by confusion; it closes with the Lord asking whether that confusion has dissolved. The two questions — was reception complete? was the confusion destroyed? — are in fact one question: has the teaching accomplished its purpose in you?",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda draws attention to the two-part structure of this verse as a model for all genuine spiritual inquiry. The first question — 'ekāgreṇa cetasā, with one-pointed mind?' — is about the quality of reception. Even the best teaching fails if the recipient's attention was fragmented or distracted. The Lord, having spoken 700 verses, now checks: was your mind present? The second question — 'ajñāna-sammohaḥ praṇaṣṭaḥ?' — is about the result. True teaching should produce the destruction of the confusion it was designed to address. Sarvapriyananda notes that 'praṇaṣṭaḥ' is a strong word: completely destroyed, not merely reduced. The Lord asks for total transformation, not partial relief. And in v73, Arjuna gives exactly the right answer.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw the Lord's question as a test that every spiritual aspirant must honestly apply to themselves after receiving teaching. Have I truly heard — with my whole being — or only with the surface of my mind? Has the confusion that brought me to seek guidance actually dissolved — or do I still carry the old turmoil under a new intellectual veneer? 'Ekāgreṇa cetasā' — one-pointed mind — is the criterion of true hearing. Yogananda taught that most spiritual students hear scripture with ninety percent of their attention and keep ten percent in reserve for skepticism, distraction, or personal agenda. The Lord asks for the full hundred percent. Only that complete receptivity allows the teaching to do what it is designed to do: dissolve the knot of ignorance entirely.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Goyandkaji explains that the Lord's question here serves a pedagogical function beyond just addressing Arjuna. Every reader of the Gita, at the end of their reading, should hear these two questions directed at themselves: 'Have you received this with full attention? Has your confusion dissolved?' These are not rhetorical questions — they are the standard against which the success of study must be measured. Goyandkaji also notes the names used: 'Pārtha' (son of Pṛthā, the mortal lineage) in the first question — emphasizing the human who must receive; 'Dhanañjaya' (conqueror of wealth, the active hero) in the second — emphasizing the one whose inner wealth of delusion must now be conquered. The Gita, through the Lord's own mouth, defines what success looks like: praṇaṣṭa — utterly destroyed — confusion."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "These eighteen words are the most important words Arjuna speaks in the entire Bhagavad Gita — and therefore among the most important words in all of Indian scripture. The Gita is a dialogue that begins with a collapse and ends with a standing-up. In Chapter 1, Arjuna fell — his bow slipped from his fingers (Ch1.v30), his body trembled, his mind reeled with grief and confusion, and he sat down in despair unable to act. Now, after eighteen chapters of the Lord's teaching, Arjuna's response is a fourfold declaration of transformation so complete it stands as the model for all spiritual progress: First — naṣṭo mohaḥ: the delusion is destroyed. Not reduced, not managed, not improved — destroyed. Moha is the root confusion, the primary misidentification of the Self with the body-mind, the source of all fear and grief. It is gone. Second — smṛtir labdhā: clarity and memory are regained. 'Smṛti' here is not ordinary memory but the recovered recognition of one's true nature. The Self was never lost — only the memory of the Self was veiled. Now the veil is lifted. Third — gata-sandehaḥ: doubts gone. The wavering mind that entertained a thousand objections, that constructed elaborate arguments for inaction, that posed unanswerable moral dilemmas — that mind is now firm and free of ambiguity. Fourth — kariṣye vacanaṃ tava: 'I will do Your word.' This is not obedience under compulsion; this is the freely chosen alignment of the human will with the Divine. And between all four declarations stands the fulcrum: tvat-prasādāt — by YOUR grace. Arjuna does not say 'I have understood.' He says 'By Your grace, I have been given back to myself.' The ego could not achieve this by its own effort. It required the descent of grace. The address 'Acyuta' — the Unfallen One — is exquisitely chosen: Arjuna, who fell, reaches toward the One who never falls. Dadaji always said: the Gita opens with 'dhṛtarāṣṭra uvāca' — the words of the blind king representing blind self-will — and closes with Arjuna's free surrender. The whole movement of the scripture is from blindness and confusion to clarity and willing action in God.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda calls this verse the perfect answer to a perfect question. In v72, the Lord asked two things: Was reception complete? Is confusion destroyed? Arjuna's v73 answers both — and adds two more declarations for good measure, so that his transformation is described from four distinct angles. The word 'smṛtiḥ' (memory) is philosophically precise. The Vedantic tradition holds that the Ātman — the true Self — is never actually absent or lost. What is lost is our recognition of it, our smṛti or recollection of what we always already are. The Gita's teaching does not create new knowledge from nothing; it removes the veil of ignorance so that the pre-existing truth of the Self shines again. 'Smṛtir labdhā' — memory regained — perfectly captures this. Liberation is not acquisition; it is recovery. Sarvapriyananda also highlights 'kariṣye' — I will do — in the future tense. Arjuna's decision to act is not a compelled reaction but a free, forward-looking intention. He has moved from the paralyzed 'na yotsye' (Ch2.v9 — I will not fight) of the beginning to the liberated 'kariṣye vacanaṃ tava' of the end. The distance between those two declarations is the distance the Gita travels — the entire spiritual journey of a human being.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda wrote at length about this verse as the crown jewel of the Gita's dialogue, the moment toward which all 700 verses were pointing. The opening state — Arjuna's collapse in Chapter 1 — was the human condition in its most honest form: the soul overwhelmed by the demands of dharmic action, paralyzed by attachment and grief, unable to act rightly. The Lord's entire teaching — on karma, jñāna, bhakti, dhyāna, the guṇas, the Self, the Supreme — was medicine for precisely this condition. And now Arjuna reports the result: the medicine has worked. Yogananda noted that 'tvat-prasādāt' — by Your grace — is the most crucial phrase in the verse. Spiritual transformation is not achieved by willpower alone. The ego cannot pull itself out of delusion by its own bootstraps. It requires the touch of grace — the descent of the Guru, the Divine Teacher, into the darkness of the student's confusion. Krishna's grace, operative throughout the dialogue, has dissolved what Arjuna's own intelligence could never dissolve. This is not a diminishment of Arjuna — it is an acknowledgment of how grace works: it does not replace the seeker's effort but completes it. The four declarations together map the stages of spiritual recovery that Yogananda saw replicated in every genuine seeker's journey: release from delusion (naṣṭo mohaḥ), return to Self-awareness (smṛtir labdhā), firmness of mind (gata-sandehaḥ), and joyful, willing action aligned with the Divine (kariṣye vacanaṃ tava).",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Goyandkaji regarded this as one of the most significant verses in all scripture — the entire Gita is justified by this one reply. He points out that Arjuna's response mirrors, in reverse, the symptoms of his original collapse. In Chapter 1, Arjuna had: delusion (moha — Ch1.v30), loss of clarity (his memory of dharmic duty was overwhelmed by emotional attachment), doubt in every form (sandeha about duty, about the future, about his own identity), and refusal to act (na yotsye — Ch2.v9). Now every symptom is reversed: moha destroyed, smṛti recovered, sandeha gone, and action freely chosen. This is the complete cure. Goyandkaji also notes that the verse contains in miniature the entire teaching of the Gita's three paths: naṣṭo mohaḥ (jñāna — knowledge destroys delusion), smṛtir labdhā and sthito'smi (dhyāna/yoga — the stable, recollected mind), and kariṣye vacanaṃ tava (karma and bhakti — action offered in love to the Divine). The final declaration — 'I will do Your word' — is not mere obedience but the highest bhakti: the joyful surrender of the individual will into the cosmic Will, acting as an instrument of the Divine in the world."

        "dadaji": "With this verse the narrative frame of the Gita reappears: we return to the court of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, where Sañjaya has been the medium through whom the blind king has heard the events of the battlefield. The entire Gita — all eighteen chapters — has taken place within this narrative frame: Sañjaya describing to Dhṛtarāṣṭra what he sees and hears through the divine vision granted by Vyāsa. Now Sañjaya steps forward as a personal witness, not merely a relay device. He says 'ahaṃ aśrauṣam' — I personally heard. And his reaction is physical, visceral, total: roma-harṣaṇam — his hair stood on end with awe and wonder. Dadaji noted that this physical response (goosebumps, horripilation) is recognized in Indian aesthetics as the involuntary response of the body to an encounter with something of supreme beauty or sacredness. Sañjaya was not merely a transmitter of data; he was a transformed receiver. And by calling Arjuna 'mahātmanaḥ' — great-souled — he recognizes that the dialogue has made Arjuna great. The Gita did not merely inform him; it ennobled him.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that this verse marks the transition in the Gita's structure from the dialogue itself to the commentary on the dialogue. The text now becomes self-referential: Sañjaya speaks about what he has heard, just as we the readers are now reading about what Sañjaya heard. This layering — Krishna speaks to Arjuna, Sañjaya hears and reports to Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and we receive it through the text — establishes the Gita as a living transmission that travels through multiple receivers without losing its potency. 'Adbhutam' (wonderful) and 'roma-harṣaṇam' (hair-raising) together describe a response that is simultaneously intellectual, emotional, and somatic — the whole person is engaged. This is the proper response to the Gita, Sarvapriyananda suggests: not merely comprehension but wonder, not merely understanding but awe that reaches into the body.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw in Sañjaya a figure of special spiritual significance. He had the gift of divine hearing (divya-dṛṣṭi granted by Vyāsa) and was thus positioned — like the ideal disciple — to receive the teaching without distortion. Yogananda noted that 'saṃvāda' — dialogue — is a richer word than mere 'kathā' (story). A saṃvāda is a meeting of minds, a mutual illumination. The Gita is a dialogue precisely because Arjuna's questions draw out of Krishna what otherwise might have remained unspoken. In this sense, Arjuna's confusion is not a weakness but a gift to humanity: it opened the space for Krishna's teaching. Sañjaya's statement 'I heard' (aśrauṣam) is in the perfect past — a completed action whose effects continue. He has been permanently transformed by what he received.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Goyandkaji explains that Sañjaya's calling the dialogue 'wonderful' (adbhutam) is a technical statement about the nature of the Gita's teaching. 'Adbhuta' in Sanskrit means 'that which has not been heard of before' or 'that which is beyond ordinary classification' — it belongs to a category of its own. The Gita synthesizes jñāna, karma, and bhakti in a manner that had never been done before, presenting a path suited for every temperament and every level of development. 'Roma-harṣaṇam' — the hair-raising quality — is not metaphorical but describes the saṃskāra (deep impression) left by genuine contact with the sacred. Goyandkaji also notes that Arjuna is called 'mahātmā' (great soul) here — a recognition that the one who sincerely seeks and receives the teaching is himself elevated to greatness by it."

        "dadaji": "This verse articulates the chain of grace through which the Gita's teaching reaches us — and it is a chain entirely made of grace, not of intellectual transmission alone. Vyāsa, the sage who compiled the scriptures, granted Sañjaya divine perception. Sañjaya heard Krishna speak to Arjuna. Sañjaya then conveys it to Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Vyāsa records the whole as the Mahābhārata. And through the text, it reaches every reader across time. At each link in this chain, grace is the operative principle. Dadaji always emphasized: 'The teaching that reaches you has been carried across thousands of years by an unbroken chain of love and care. Receive it with the same reverence.' 'Sākṣāt... svayam' — directly, Himself — emphasizes that what Sañjaya received was not a report about Krishna's teaching but the teaching itself, live, in the moment of its utterance. The Gita is thus always a present-tense event for the sincere receiver.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda highlights the phrase 'yogeśvarāt kṛṣṇāt' — from Krishna the Lord of Yoga — as the verse's doctrinal heart. By calling Krishna 'Yogeśvara' (Lord of all Yoga), the text affirms that all the paths described in the Gita — karma yoga, jñāna yoga, bhakti yoga, dhyāna yoga, rāja yoga — are unified in the one Source who masters and transcends them all. The apparent diversity of the Gita's teaching is held together by this one Teacher. Sarvapriyananda also notes that 'guhyam param' — supreme secret — echoes the language of v63 and v64, where the Lord described the supreme secret as the disclosure of His very heart. Sañjaya acknowledges having received precisely that — the innermost teaching of the Divine, delivered in person.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw this verse as confirmation of the Gita's status as direct revelation rather than merely human wisdom. When a teaching comes 'sākṣāt svayam' — directly from the Divine Himself — it carries a different authority than philosophical speculation, however brilliant. The Gita is not Vyāsa's reasoning about God; it is God speaking, with Vyāsa and Sañjaya as divinely empowered receivers and transmitters. Yogananda taught that every sincere reading of the Gita, undertaken with the right attitude, recapitulates this direct reception — the receptive soul becomes for a moment like Sañjaya, hearing the Lord's own words fresh. 'Vyāsa-prasādāt' — by Vyāsa's grace — reminds us that even the capacity to receive the teaching is itself a gift. The ego cannot earn access to the Supreme Secret; it can only be granted it.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Goyandkaji explains that this verse teaches the proper attitude with which to approach the Gita: as recipients of grace in a chain of grace, not as independent scholars extracting information from a text. 'Guhyam param' — the supreme secret — is secret not because it is deliberately concealed but because it is inaccessible to the un-prepared mind. The secret is openly stated throughout the Gita; it is only 'secret' to those whose hearts are not yet tuned to receive it. Goyandkaji also notes that Sañjaya's acknowledgment of his dependence on Vyāsa's grace models the humility appropriate to all receivers of this teaching. The one who claims to have understood the Gita by his own intellect alone has, by that very claim, revealed that he has missed its deepest teaching."

        "dadaji": "Sañjaya has moved from witness to devotee. The narrator who began as a reporter of events has been transformed by what he witnessed — and now he cannot stop returning to it in memory, each return producing fresh joy. 'Saṃsmṛtya saṃsmṛtya' — the doubling of the word is the grammatical enactment of the experience: the repetition of the phrase mimics the repetition of the act. And 'muhur muhuḥ' at the end — again and again, again and again — creates a verse that is structurally a circle, turning back on itself in endless delight. Dadaji taught that this is the experience of anyone who has genuinely received the Gita: you return to it again and again, and each return feels like the first time. The joy is not diminished by familiarity; it deepens. 'Puṇyam' — holy — indicates that the mere remembering of this dialogue is itself an act of merit, a sacred activity. To remember the Gita's dialogue is to participate again in the grace it carries.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda points out that Sañjaya models here what might be called the 'bhakti of memory' — the devotional practice of remembering the divine encounter. In the Bhāgavata tradition, the remembrance of the Lord's acts and words (smaraṇa) is itself a path of devotion. Sañjaya is practicing smaraṇa with the Gita's dialogue as its content, and the fruit is exactly what is promised: 'hṛṣyāmi' — I am thrilled, I rejoice. The spiritual literature of India often describes the saint as one who is overcome with joy in the mere memory of the Divine. Here Sañjaya — a secondary character, a narrator — achieves this state simply by having received and remembered the Gita's dialogue. It suggests that proximity to the sacred, even through the role of a witness, carries transformative power.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw in Sañjaya's repeated joy a description of the soul's natural response to contact with the Divine — and a model for the spiritual practice of recollection. After deep meditation or powerful scriptural reception, the devotee returns again and again in memory to what was received, and each return produces fresh waves of bliss. Yogananda called this 'the afterglow of divine contact' — the fact that genuine spiritual experience, unlike sensory pleasure, does not diminish in recollection but amplifies. 'Muhur muhuḥ' — again and again — is Sañjaya's report that each remembrance is as fresh and joyful as the first. This is the sign of genuine transformation: the experience is not trapped in the past but alive in every moment of return.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Goyandkaji explains that the name 'Keśava' used here for Krishna has significance. Keśava — connected to the story of Krishna slaying the demon Keśī — represents the Divine power that defeats the demonic forces of ego and ignorance. The dialogue of Keśava and Arjuna is therefore the dialogue of the demon-slaying Divine with the awakened human soul. Goyandkaji notes that 'puṇyam' is applied to the dialogue itself — the conversation of the Gita is sacred, merit-conferring, not merely informative. This accords with the tradition that hearing, reading, or reciting the Gita is itself a pious act (a view established firmly in v70-71). Sañjaya's personal testimony that he cannot stop rejoicing in the memory is the scripture's own validation of its transformative power."

        "dadaji": "In v76 Sañjaya rejoices in remembering the dialogue — the teaching, the words, the saṃvāda of Keśava and Arjuna. In v77 he rejoices in remembering the form — the cosmic viśva-rūpa of Ch11 that Arjuna beheld and that Sañjaya also witnessed through Vyāsa's gift. The Gita's final verses thus make explicit what the scripture contains: not only teaching (word) but vision (form). The complete spiritual path involves both the understanding of what the Divine says and the direct experience of what the Divine is. 'Aty-adbhutam' — most extraordinarily wonderful — is a superlative of a superlative. 'Vismayo me mahān' — great wonder fills me — indicates a response even deeper than joy: the speechless awe of one who has been in the presence of the Infinite and knows that no description can contain it. Dadaji said that the two verses together describe the two gifts of the Gita: it gives the teaching for the mind and the vision for the heart. Both must be received.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda notes the important distinction between v76 and v77. In v76, the response is 'hṛṣyāmi' — joy, delight, thrilled happiness at the sacred dialogue. In v77, the primary response is 'vismayo me mahān' — great wonder, cosmic awe — before the joy returns. The cosmic form of Ch11 produces first wonder (vismaya) — the appropriate response to the Infinite encountered directly — and then joy. This sequence (awe before joy) reflects the authentic pattern of mystical experience: the encounter with the truly Infinite first stuns the mind into silence before it produces the overflow of bliss. 'Aty-adbhutam rūpam hareḥ' — Sañjaya is still overwhelmed by the memory of what he saw, even now, in retrospect. The cosmic vision is not a memory that fades; it persists in its full overwhelming power.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw in this verse the Gita's affirmation that the complete spiritual life involves both the reception of divine wisdom (v76) and the direct experience of the Divine (v77). Many people receive the teaching of the Gita intellectually and feel joy. But those who have had even a glimpse of the Divine reality that underlies the teaching — who have had their own version of Arjuna's experience in Ch11 — know a different order of wonder altogether. 'Vismayo me mahān' — Sañjaya's great wonder — is the mark of direct encounter. Yogananda taught that the Gita's deepest purpose is not to convey information but to produce in the reader the same experience of the Divine that Arjuna had — and that Sañjaya, through Vyāsa's gift, also received. Verses 76 and 77 together say: the Gita gives both.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Goyandkaji explains the name 'Hari' used here for Krishna. 'Hari' means the one who removes — specifically, who removes pāpa (sin), ajñāna (ignorance), and the entire web of saṃsāra. The form remembered is therefore not merely beautiful or awe-inspiring; it is the form of the Remover, the Liberator, the one whose very vision dissolves what binds us. That Sañjaya's wonder (vismaya) is 'mahān' — great — indicates that even for one who received this vision through divine grace and has had time to reflect on it, the wonder remains undiminished. Goyandkaji notes that this stands in contrast to worldly experiences, all of which diminish in memory. The experience of the Divine, properly received, intensifies in recollection — each remembrance reveals a new depth of what was seen."

        "dadaji": "The final verse of the Bhagavad Gita is not a grand proclamation from the Lord — it is a quiet, firm declaration from Sañjaya, the human witness. And what Sañjaya says in this verse is not a religious dogma but a universal law: when the Divine and the aligned human will act together, all four supreme goods — grace (śrī), victory (vijaya), power (bhūti), and eternal righteousness (dhruvā nīti) — arise naturally and inevitably. This is the Gita's final teaching, stated in the plainest possible language: alignment with the Divine produces all that is worth having. The verse has a perfect bilateral structure: 'yatra... yatra...' — wherever Krishna, wherever Arjuna — 'tatra...' — there is everything. Two conditions, four fruits, one conclusion. Dadaji meditated on the two figures in this verse for decades. 'Yogeśvaraḥ Kṛṣṇaḥ' — Krishna the Lord of all Yoga — represents the Divine in its fullness: the source of all paths, the summit of all practices, the ocean into which all rivers of spiritual seeking flow. 'Pārthaḥ dhanur-dharaḥ' — Pārtha the bow-bearer — represents the human soul in its fullness: not retreating into passivity but actively engaged in its dharmic duty, bow in hand, fully present in the field of life. The Gita's highest vision is not a soul that escapes the world but a soul that is fully in the world with the Lord. That is the bow-bearing Arjuna who has heard the Gita. And 'matir mama' — this is my conviction — is Sañjaya's personal signature. He does not cite a scripture; he offers his own testimony. He has witnessed the entire dialogue, the entire transformation of Arjuna, and his conclusion — earned through witnessing — is this verse. Dadaji said: 'Make this verse your own. Make the certainty of Sañjaya yours. Wherever you are, bring Krishna there. Carry your bow — your duty, your presence, your engaged action. And all will be well.'",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda regards this as one of the most perfectly constructed verses in Sanskrit literature — and the most perfectly placed: it is the last word. After 700 verses spanning every dimension of dharma, metaphysics, psychology, cosmology, devotion, and action, the Gita closes with a single sentence of absolute simplicity: the Divine and the surrendered human together — that is enough. That is everything. Sarvapriyananda notes that the verse operates at multiple levels simultaneously. At the historical level: in the war about to be fought, the Pāṇḍavas (with Krishna guiding them) will prevail over the Kauravas. At the philosophical level: wherever the supreme consciousness (Krishna as Yogeśvara) is present in the human heart and wherever that heart is actively engaged in dharma (Arjuna dhanur-dharaḥ), right outcomes — inner and outer — must follow. At the universal level: the verse encapsulates the entire message of the Gita in two lines. The four fruits listed are not rewards for virtue but the natural consequences of alignment: śrī (divine grace flowing through the aligned life), vijaya (the victory of truth over untruth, dharma over adharma), bhūti (the flourishing and well-being of the soul and the world), and dhruvā nīti (the eternal righteous order that sustains creation). 'Dhruvā' — eternal, like the pole star — ensures that this is not a passing victory but a permanent alignment with what is eternally right. And 'matir mama' — this is my conviction — is Sañjaya closing the scripture with the authority of a witness rather than the authority of a doctrine. The Gita does not end with the Lord commanding belief; it ends with a human being sharing what he has personally come to know. That is the Gita's democracy of wisdom: available to every sincere witness.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw in this final verse the deepest philosophical statement of the Bhagavad Gita — and a direct description of the law of consciousness. 'Wherever Yogeśvara Krishna' — wherever divine consciousness is present, wherever the soul has turned toward and opened to the supreme Reality — 'and wherever Pārtha the bow-bearer' — wherever the individual will, instead of retreating in confusion or acting in ego, has aligned itself with that divine consciousness in active, engaged living — there the four supreme goods arise without fail. They are not given from outside as rewards; they arise as the natural expression of that alignment. Yogananda taught that the Gita's entire teaching can be condensed to this: know yourself as the Ātman (Yogeśvara's domain), perform your duty with love and without attachment (Pārtha's bow), and liberation and all its attendant graces are not a future achievement but a present reality. 'Śrī vijayo bhūtir dhruvā nītiḥ' — these are not four separate things but four faces of the one state of full divine-human alignment. Yogananda called them the fourfold fruit: divine grace (śrī = the beauty and abundance that flow from the divine presence), right victory (vijaya = outcomes aligned with truth and dharma), real prosperity (bhūti = the soul's true flourishing, not merely material), and cosmic ethics (dhruvā nīti = the eternal righteous order that holds the universe). Wherever Krishna and Arjuna are together, the universe is held in its proper alignment. This is not mythology — it is metaphysics. And it is a truth available to every human being who chooses to make it personal: to seek the Yogeśvara in their own heart and to bear their own bow in their own field. 'Matir mama' — Yogananda heard in these last words the voice of every sincere seeker who has walked this path and emerged on the other side. It is not the Lord's authoritative decree but the disciple's hard-won conviction. And that, the scripture implies, is more powerful than any decree: the free, fearless, love-born conviction of a soul that has witnessed the truth and can no longer doubt it.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Goyandkaji devoted some of his most careful exegetical attention to this closing verse, calling it 'the seed that contains the entire tree of the Gita.' He notes that the verse uses 'yatra' (wherever) rather than 'yadi' (if) — the Lord of Yoga and the bow-bearing Pārtha are not hypothetical; they are ever-present realities for one who has received the Gita's teaching. 'Yogeśvaraḥ Kṛṣṇaḥ' and 'Pārthaḥ dhanur-dharaḥ' are the two terms of the eternal equation: the Divine ground of being (Kṛṣṇa as Yogeśvara) and the engaged human instrument (Arjuna with his bow — active, present, dharmic). When these two are together — when the individual has found the Yogeśvara in his own heart AND is actively fulfilling his dharma in the world — then śrī, vijaya, bhūti, and dhruvā nīti are not goals to be pursued but conditions that already exist. They do not come after alignment; they ARE the alignment. Goyandkaji also draws attention to the fourfold structure of the fruits as a complete description of the good life at four levels: śrī (the spiritual, the divine grace dimension), vijaya (the heroic, the dimension of right action and its fruit), bhūti (the personal, the dimension of inner and outer flourishing), and dhruvā nīti (the cosmic, the dimension of eternal righteous order). The Gita closes by promising all four — for the individual, for society, and for the cosmos — when the human will surrenders into divine alignment. 'Matir mama' — Sañjaya's personal conviction — is Goyandkaji's invitation to every reader: make this your matir, your firm conviction. Not borrowed belief, but the certainty earned through the sincere reception of this supreme teaching. This is the Gita's final word — and it is sufficient."
