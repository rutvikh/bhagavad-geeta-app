        "dadaji": "Beloved, Shri Krishna concludes His luminous list of twenty qualities of wisdom with these two crown jewels: the unwavering abidance in self-knowledge, and the clear vision of what Truth-knowledge truly means. He tenderly tells us that all qualities from humility to devotion are not mere virtues but expressions of jñāna itself. Whatever falls short of this — pride, cruelty, restlessness — is nothing but ajñāna, darkness pretending to be light. Let your life be a constant prayer toward knowing the Self, and all else will fall into its rightful place.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "From the Advaita standpoint, this closing verse of the jñāna-lakṣaṇa section is particularly significant. Krishna defines jñāna not merely as intellectual information but as nityatva — unbroken abidance — in adhyātma-jñāna, the knowledge 'I am the Self.' Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam means the sustained insight into the very purpose of Self-knowledge, which is liberation from the false identification with the kṣetra. The twenty qualities described from verse 8 are thus not prerequisites for jñāna but rather its very characteristics — the flower through which the fragrance of Self-knowledge is known.",
        "yogananda": "Master Patanjali taught that wisdom is a living flame that must burn continuously without interruption. That is precisely what Krishna means by adhyātma-jñāna-nityatva — not occasional meditation but a ceaseless inward attunement to the divine Self within. Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam is the penetrating insight that sees through all appearances to the single Truth underlying creation. When this flame of Self-knowledge burns brightly, ignorance — which is merely the absence of that light — dissolves as naturally as darkness before the dawn.",
        "goyandka": "This verse serves as the conclusive definition-verse (lakṣaṇa-śloka) closing the twenty-quality enumeration that began at verse 8. Śrī Śaṅkarācārya notes that 'adhyātma-jñāna-nityatva' refers to the continuous inclination (nitya-pravṛtti) of the mind toward the knowledge of the Supreme Self, not merely occasional study. 'Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam' signifies seeing the ultimate purpose (mokṣa) for which tattva-jñāna exists. The verse establishes a clear epistemic standard: any mental orientation contrary to these — identification with body, ego-assertion, sensory craving — belongs to the domain of ajñāna and is the cause of saṃsāra."

        "dadaji": "With a lover's eagerness, Shri Krishna says: 'Listen — I will tell you the most precious secret. Know this and you shall never die.' That jñeyam, the knowable, is Brahman — beginningless, with Krishna Himself as its highest expression. It is not a 'thing' that exists like a pot or a planet, nor is it a mere nothing. It transcends both existence and non-existence because it is the very ground from which those categories arise. This is the knowledge that breaks the cycle of birth and death and bestows immortality — not a future event but the recognition of what you have always been.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The phrase 'na sat tan nāsad ucyate' is of profound Vedāntic significance. Brahman cannot be called 'sat' in the way the phenomenal world claims existence, because It has no limiting adjuncts, no specific locus, and is not an object of perception. Yet It cannot be called 'asat' (non-existent) like a sky-flower or a barren woman's son, because It is self-luminously real. The Upaniṣads similarly declare Brahman as 'neti neti' — not this, not this. 'Anādi mat-param brahma' establishes that this Brahman is not a created entity; It is the beginningless substratum, and Krishna, as Paramātman, is its supreme reality.",
        "yogananda": "When the great Sages say God is beyond description, they do not mean He is unknowable in experience — they mean He is beyond the imprisonment of concepts. 'Na sat, na asat' — not the kind of existence that things have, not the kind of absence that vacuums have. He is the Infinite Presence that underlies both. Knowing this Brahman — through deep meditation and the grace of a true Guru — one tastes amṛtam, the nectar of immortality, the direct experience that one's own consciousness is the deathless divine. This is the supreme promise Krishna makes to every sincere seeker.",
        "goyandka": "This verse inaugurates the jñeyam-prakaraṇa (section on the knowable) which extends through verse 18. The term 'anādi mat-param brahma' is analyzed by commentators in two ways: (1) mat-param = having Paramātman as its inner controller and highest expression, or (2) mat-param = known through My grace. The ontological status of Brahman as 'neither sat nor asat' follows the Upaniṣadic method of exclusion (apavāda). Brahman is not sat like the temporary objects of the world, and not asat like an illusion; It is sat-cit-ānanda — pure existence-consciousness-bliss — which the sat/asat dichotomy cannot capture."

        "dadaji": "Shri Krishna paints the most breathtaking portrait of the Beloved — not with a brush but with the language of omnipresence. The hands of every craftsman, the feet of every pilgrim, the eyes of every mother gazing at her child — these are His hands, His feet, His eyes. Brahman is not distant in some heaven; It pervades every corner of this world, behind every form and every function. When this understanding dawns even partially, one begins to see the sacred in everything and everyone, and love flows naturally toward all of creation.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse follows the classical Vedāntic description of Brahman's immanence through the via positiva — attributing all qualities universally. From the Advaita perspective, Brahman does not literally have limbs, but since all hands, feet, eyes, and ears are expressions of one consciousness, it is not wrong to say Brahman perceives through every eye and acts through every hand. This is not pantheism (the world equals God) but panentheism (the world is in God, and God pervades the world while transcending it). The Puruṣa-sūkta of the Ṛgveda resonates here — the cosmic Person whose feet are the earth, whose eye is the sun.",
        "yogananda": "The cosmic vision described here is what the great masters experience in their highest states of samādhi: the entire universe perceived as one pulsating divine body. Every star is God's eye; every river His voice; every wind His breath. Paramhansa Ramakrishna would enter ecstasy seeing God in every face. This verse is not mythology — it is a precise description of what the awakened consciousness perceives. All of creation is one organism, and Brahman is the single life animating every cell of it. To know this even intellectually begins the journey; to experience it is liberation itself.",
        "goyandka": "The description in this verse echoes the famous Puruṣa-sūkta (Ṛgveda 10.90) and the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad (3.16): 'sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādas tat sarvato'kṣi-śiro-mukham.' The repetition of 'sarvataḥ' four times emphasizes the total, unrestricted pervasiveness of Brahman. Commentators note that the attribution of sense organs is metaphorical (upacāra), not literal — Brahman being niravayava (without parts). The real meaning: there is no region of the universe, no function of life, no moment of experience where Brahman is absent. It 'stands' (tiṣṭhati) — indicating immovable steadiness even while pervading movement."

He illumines every sense — through your eyes He sees, through your ears He hears — yet He Himself has no eyes, no ears. He sustains every atom of creation yet clings to nothing. He appears as though experiencing pleasure and pain through all beings, yet He is eternally beyond all qualities. This is the divine paradox that only love can hold without contradiction: utterly intimate with everything, eternally free from everything.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This is the famous 'ābhāsa verse' of the thirteenth chapter — Brahman is the reflection or the appearing-light behind all sensory functions. 'Guṇābhāsam' means Brahman appears as or illumines the functions of the senses, which themselves are products of the three guṇas of Prakṛti. The paradoxes in this verse — 'with senses / without senses,' 'unattached / sustains all,' 'nirguṇa / guṇa-bhoktā' — are the language of the Absolute describing Itself through the lens of Māyā. In pure Advaita, Brahman is nirguṇa and asaṅga; the appearance of guṇa-enjoyment belongs only to the upādhi (limiting adjunct), not to Brahman Itself.",
        "yogananda": "The spiritual law revealed here is this: the divine Consciousness that you seek is the very power by which you seek. It illumines your eyes so you can look for it, energizes your mind so you can think about it — and all the while remains perfectly still, unentangled, free. This is why great teachers say 'You cannot attain God; you can only recognize that God is already what you are.' The guṇas play their dance of creation; Brahman is the silent stage. Asaktam — unattached — is the key word. No matter how tumultuous life becomes, the Self within is always asaktam, always free, always at peace.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Śaṅkarācārya's commentary on this verse emphasizes that 'guṇābhāsam' does not mean Brahman literally possesses the qualities of senses, but that It is the chit-śakti (consciousness-power) that illumines (ābhāsayati) the sense-functions. The four paradoxical pairs in this verse mirror the mahāvākya method: Brahman transcends description yet must be described. Viśiṣṭādvaitins like Rāmānuja interpret 'sarva-bhṛt' as the inner controller (antaryāmin) who sustains all, while 'guṇa-bhoktṛ' refers to the jīvātman within Brahman's body. In either school, Brahman's sovereign independence from Prakṛti remains uncompromised."

The more refined our inner life becomes, the closer He seems, until one day there is no distance at all.",

'Bahir antaś ca' — both inside and outside — addresses the apparent limitation of saying Brahman is 'within': It equally pervades the so-called 'exterior.' 'Acaram caram' — both static and dynamic — is the Advaita teaching that Brahman is the unchanged substratum of all change. The phrase 'sūkṣmatvāt avijñeyam' is crucial: Brahman is not incomprehensible due to complexity but due to ultimacy of subtlety — It is the most subtle subject, and the subject can never become an object of ordinary cognition. The famous Kaṭha Upaniṣad teaching resonates: 'aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān' — subtler than the subtle, greater than the great.",
        "yogananda": "Scientists have not found God with telescopes pointed outward or microscopes pointed inward — because He is the very consciousness doing the looking. 'Sūkṣmatvāt avijñeyam' — too subtle for any instrument, too intimate for any distance. The mystic's journey is the reversal of the search: from looking out to looking in, from trying to grasp to learning to be still. When the mental turbulence subsides in deep meditation, what remains is not emptiness but the closest, most immediate Presence — always here, always now. 'Antike ca' — God is nearer to you than you are to yourself.",
        "goyandka": "The verse describes the vibhu (all-pervading) nature of Brahman through three paradoxical pairs: inner/outer, static/moving, far/near. Śrī Madhvācārya notes that 'acaram' (unmoving) refers to Brahman's own immovable nature while 'caram' refers to Its appearing as moving creation. The epithet 'sūkṣmatvāt avijñeyam' is consistent with the Taittirīya Upaniṣad's teaching that Brahman is subtler than space (ākāśa). The 'dūra-stham / antike' duality was famously rendered by the Īśāvāsya Upaniṣad (mantra 5): 'tad dūre tad u antike' — that is far away; that is also near. Direct knowledge of Brahman requires the dissolution of the very subject-object duality that makes it seem distant."

He is bhūta-bhartṛ — the loving Father who sustains every one of His children. He is grasiṣṇu — Time, which tenderly withdraws all forms back into Himself. And He is prabhaviṣṇu — the endlessly creative source, ever bringing forth new forms from His infinite abundance. He is the whole drama: creation, sustenance, and dissolution — all resting in His oneness.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The word 'iva' in 'vibhaktam iva' carries the entire weight of Advaita Vedānta. Brahman is not truly divided into the multiplicity of jīvas and objects — the division is apparent (vivartam), the product of Māyā. This is the key distinction between Advaita and Sāṃkhya: Sāṃkhya posits a real multiplicity of puruṣas; Advaita says there is one Brahman appearing as many. The three epithets — bhartṛ, grasiṣṇu, prabhaviṣṇu — correspond to Viṣṇu's triple function as the cosmic sustainer (sthiti), Śiva's function as the dissolver (laya), and Brahmā's function as the creator (sṛṣṭi). But all three inhere in the single Brahman being described.",
        "yogananda": "One sunlight enters ten thousand windows and appears as ten thousand beams, yet it is one light. So Brahman enters all creatures and appears as innumerable individual souls — 'vibhaktam iva' — divided in appearance only. Every mystic tradition has touched this truth: 'Thou art That,' 'I and the Father are one,' 'Ahaṃ Brahmāsmi.' The three roles — creator, sustainer, devourer — are merely three faces of the one timeless Presence playing the cosmic game. To know this is to be released from the fear of death, because grasiṣṇu only 'devours' forms, never the eternal Self.",
        "goyandka": "The philosophical crux of this verse lies in the word 'iva' (as if), which Śrī Śaṅkarācārya uses to anchor his Māyāvāda (doctrine of illusion): the division of Brahman is not real but apparent, produced by the upādhis (limiting conditions) of individual beings. Just as space appears divided when viewed through different pots, Brahman appears as multiple jīvas. The triad grasiṣṇu-prabhaviṣṇu-bhartṛ encapsulates the Vedic cosmological cycle: the universe periodically dissolves back into Brahman (pralaya) and emerges again (sṛṣṭi), while being sustained throughout (sthiti). This jñeyam — the knowable Brahman — encompasses the entire cycle without being affected by any of it."

        "dadaji": "Of all the verses in this chapter, this one shines like the very thing it describes. 'Jyotiṣām api taj jyotiḥ' — Light of lights — the sun shines, but who lights the sun? The eyes see, but who illumines the seer? That innermost radiance which makes all knowing possible is Brahman, and it dwells right here, in your own heart, in the heart of every being. It is the knower, the known, and the very act of knowing — all three dissolved into one luminous presence. To find God, you need not go anywhere. Simply become still, look inward, and let the Light already shining in your heart reveal itself.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is among the most celebrated in the Gītā and finds its Upaniṣadic parallel in the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad: 'na tatra sūryo bhāti na candra-tārakam... tam eva bhāntam anubhāti sarvaṃ tasya bhāsā sarvam idaṃ vibhāti' — the sun does not shine there, nor the moon; only by the light of that Self do all things shine. 'Jyotiṣām api taj jyotiḥ' — the consciousness that illumines the sun cannot itself be lit by the sun. The triplet 'jñānaṃ jñeyaṃ jñāna-gamyam' collapses the Sāṃkhya trinity of pramātā-prameya-pramāṇa (knower-known-means) into the single non-dual Brahman. 'Hṛdi sarvasya viṣṭhitam' — most intimate, most near.",
        "yogananda": "In deep meditation, a great light appears within — not imagined but perceived with a clarity that makes outer sunlight seem pale. This inner light is what Krishna describes as 'jyotiṣām api taj jyotiḥ' — the light that lights all other lights. Paramhansa Yogananda often spoke of seeing the spiritual eye, that light of Brahman, in deep states of samādhi. This is not metaphor; it is the most literal reality. The heart referred to as the dwelling place of this Light is the spiritual heart, the hṛdaya-guhā — the cave of the heart — which the Upaniṣads speak of as smaller than a mustard seed yet vaster than all universes.",
        "goyandka": "This verse is called the 'jyotir-verse' by classical commentators and represents the climax of the jñeyam-prakaraṇa. The sequential triplet 'jñānam jñeyam jñāna-gamyam' has been variously interpreted: (1) Brahman is itself the pramāna (knowing), pramey (known), and pramātr (knower) — all three collapsed into one; or (2) jñānam = the light of knowledge by which all is illumined; jñeyam = the object toward which all knowledge moves; jñāna-gamyam = the ultimate goal of the entire epistemological journey. 'Hṛdi sarvasya viṣṭhitam' is the Vedic truth of Brahman as the antaryāmin (inner dweller), echoing the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad's antaryāmin-brāhmaṇa."

        "dadaji": "Shri Krishna closes the first great movement of Chapter 13 with a beautiful personal note. He has spoken of fields and knowers, wisdom qualities and the boundless Brahman — but notice how He concludes: 'My devotee, knowing this, reaches My state.' Not the philosopher's state, not the ascetic's state — My state. The synthesis is complete: true knowledge (jñāna) and true love (bhakti) are not rivals. The devotee who understands this teaching doesn't merely become wise — they become like the Beloved himself. Mad-bhāva is the ultimate homecoming: becoming one with the divine nature that was never really separate.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This summary verse is of great theological significance because of the word 'mad-bhakta.' Śrī Śaṅkara acknowledges that even within the jñāna-mārga, bhakti is the integrating factor — it is the devotee's orientation toward Brahman that makes the knowledge transformative rather than merely intellectual. 'Vijñāya' (having truly understood — experientially, not merely conceptually) is the operative word. Vijñāna in Vedāntic usage refers to the direct apprehension of truth (anubhava), distinguished from mere śravaṇa (hearing) or manana (reflection). The goal 'mad-bhāvāya upapadyate' is the Gītā's recurring description of liberation: not a remote heaven but the very nature (bhāva) of the Lord.",
        "yogananda": "This verse illustrates that the Gītā never separates knowledge from devotion. True jñāna, when it deepens, inevitably becomes bhakti — for what is love but the recognition of one's own deepest nature in another? The devotee who understands the teaching of kṣetra and kṣetrajña, who penetrates the mystery of Brahman as the light of lights, does not remain a mere knower — they are transformed, elevated to mad-bhāva, the very state and nature of the Divine. This is liberation not as extinction but as expansion — the dropping of the small self into the infinite ocean of the Self.",
        "goyandka": "This verse functions as the upa-saṃhāra (concluding summary) of the first major section of Chapter 13 (verses 1-18). The three topics — kṣetra, jñāna, and jñeyam — precisely correspond to the three opening questions asked by Arjuna (which are implicit in the structure): What is the field? What is true knowledge? What is to be known? Krishna has answered all three. The use of 'mad-bhakta' (My devotee) rather than 'jñānī' (knower) signals the Gītā's consistent position that pure jñāna and pure bhakti converge at the highest level. Mad-bhāva is liberation as identity with Brahman — sāyujya-mukti in the bhakti tradition, brahma-nirvāṇa in the jñāna tradition."

        "dadaji": "Shri Krishna now opens a new vista, shifting from the description of Brahman to the practical teaching of how the soul becomes entangled in the world. Two great principles exist: Prakṛti — the vast creative energy of Nature, ceaselessly transforming — and Puruṣa — the still, luminous witness-Self. Both are beginningless; neither was created from something prior. All the guṇas, all the vikāras — the entire drama of creation — spring from Prakṛti alone. Puruṣa simply witnesses. Understanding this distinction is the first step toward freedom: I am the witness, not the witnessed; the knower, not the known.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse begins the third major prakaraṇa (section) of Chapter 13 — the Sāṃkhya-Yoga exposition on Prakṛti and Puruṣa, which runs through verse 23. The statement that both Prakṛti and Puruṣa are 'anādi' (beginningless) diverges from pure Advaita, where only Brahman is ultimately real and Prakṛti has no ultimate ontological status. From the vyāvahārika (empirical) perspective, however, both are accepted as beginningless — this is the teaching level appropriate for Arjuna's understanding. The twenty-four tattvas of Sāṃkhya (mahat, ahaṅkāra, five tanmātras, five mahābhūtas, ten indriyas, manas) are all 'vikāras' — modifications — of Prakṛti.",
        "yogananda": "The spiritual seeker must understand these two fundamental principles: consciousness (Puruṣa) and energy (Prakṛti). God created the universe through the interplay of His consciousness and His creative power. You as a soul are Puruṣa — pure, unchanging awareness. The body, mind, senses, and all that changes is Prakṛti. When you mistakenly identify as Prakṛti — as the body, the emotions, the thoughts — you feel bound. When you rest in your true Puruṣa-nature — the still witness within — you are free. This discrimination between Puruṣa and Prakṛti (viveka) is the heart of both Sāṃkhya philosophy and the practice of meditation.",
        "goyandka": "Classical Sāṃkhya posits twenty-five tattvas: Puruṣa (1) + Prakṛti (1) + Mahat/Buddhi (1) + Ahaṅkāra (1) + five Tanmātras + five Mahābhūtas + five Jñānendriyas + five Karmendriyas + Manas = 25. All except Puruṣa and Prakṛti are vikāras of Prakṛti. The Gītā integrates this Sāṃkhya framework within its theistic vision: Puruṣa here is not one of many (as in classical Sāṃkhya) but ultimately the one supreme Puruṣa, Paramātman. 'Anādī ubhāv api' — the beginninglessness of both is asserted at the empirical level; at the paramārtika level, only Brahman is eternal. The guṇas (sattva, rajas, tamas) are Prakṛti's fundamental modes, and all of manifest existence is their interplay."

Prakṛti acts — she is the great doer, the producer of all causes and effects, the weaver of the body, the sharpener of the mind. Puruṣa experiences — he is the one who feels pleasure and pain, joy and grief. Now see the subtlety: Puruṣa is actually a pure witness, but because he identifies with Prakṛti's activities, he thinks 'I am experiencing, I am suffering, I am enjoying.' Liberation is when Puruṣa recognizes: 'I am not the doer; I am not the sufferer; I am the eternal witness.' This single recognition can end lifetimes of bondage in a single moment of grace.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse establishes the Sāṃkhya-Yoga categorical distinction between Prakṛti as kartā (doer) and Puruṣa as bhoktā (experiencer). From the strict Sāṃkhya standpoint, both kartṛtva and bhoktṛtva are ultimately illusory: Prakṛti acts but has no consciousness to actually 'do'; Puruṣa is conscious but immovable, so it cannot actually 'experience.' It is the confused association (saṃyoga) between the two that creates the appearance of an agent-experiencer. The Yoga of discrimination — viveka-khyāti — consists in seeing that 'Prakṛti acts' and 'Puruṣa witnesses' and never the twain shall truly meet. This clarity dissolves the sense of bondage.",
        "yogananda": "Every experience of pleasure and pain happens in the body and nervous system — in Prakṛti — and is registered by the mind. But the soul (Puruṣa) in its pure nature is only the witness. When we identify with the body, we think 'I am in pain.' When we identify with the mind, we think 'I am anxious.' But step back into the awareness that simply watches — and there is no pain, no anxiety, only pure witnessing. This is the practice of Sāṃkhya, and it is the deepest yoga: disidentify from all that changes (Prakṛti) and rest in the unchanging awareness (Puruṣa). This is what Patañjali calls kaivalya — the aloneness of pure consciousness.",
        "goyandka": "The verse draws the Sāṃkhya distinction between the two aspects of causation: Prakṛti is the nimittopādāna-kāraṇa (the instrumental and material cause) for all kāryas (effects such as body, world) and kāraṇas (instruments such as senses, mind). Puruṣa is neither cause nor actor in the Sāṃkhya sense, but its proximity to Prakṛti creates the adhyāsa (superimposition) by which the pure witness appears as bhoktā. Śrī Śaṅkara uses this verse to show that bondage is rooted in the false identification of Puruṣa with Prakṛti's modifications. Liberation (mukti) is the cessation of this false association — not a new achievement but the recognition of what was always the case: Puruṣa was never truly bound, never truly a bhoktā."
