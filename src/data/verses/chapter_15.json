        "dadaji": "The Lord opens this sacred chapter with the image of the Aśvattha tree whose roots reach upward into the infinite sky of Brahman — how beautifully He reveals that the source of all creation is above, in the Divine! The Vedas are compared to leaves — beautiful, life-giving, and cherished — yet they point to the tree, not to its root. Dadaji would say: true knowledge is not merely reciting the scriptures, but tracing every leaf, every branch, every root upward to the Beloved who is the source of all. One who truly knows this tree — this cosmic display of the Lord — is the real knower of the Vedas.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse draws directly from the Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2.3.1), where the same inverted Aśvattha imagery appears as a symbol of saṃsāra — the phenomenal universe. The roots above (ūrdhva-mūlam) indicate that Pure Consciousness, Brahman, is the ultimate ground of all existence, while the branches spreading downward represent the gross and subtle manifestations of Prakṛti. The Vedas as leaves is a penetrating metaphor: the scriptures nourish and sustain the tree of dharma, but they are not the root itself. Vedānta urges us to go beyond the leaves to the root — beyond the words of the Veda to the silent Brahman they point toward.",
        "yogananda": "The cosmic tree of existence described here is the great Tree of Life known to mystics of all traditions — its taproot anchored in the Divine and its branches reaching into the relativities of time and space. God is the root hidden above in transcendence, and the visible world is the canopy of His self-expression below. The Vedas as leaves is a luminous image: just as leaves receive light and convert it into life-sustaining energy, the Vedic teachings receive the light of Truth and translate it into wisdom that nourishes the soul. To truly know this tree — to trace the visible back to the invisible Source — is the summit of all learning.",
        "goyandka": "The Lord begins Puruṣottama Yoga by citing a teaching that was ancient even in His time — the inverted cosmic tree of the Kaṭha Upaniṣad. 'Avyayam' qualifies the tree as eternally existing, not subject to destruction in the ultimate sense, because saṃsāra as a category of experience endures as long as ignorance endures. The chandāṃsi (Vedic metres/hymns) as parṇāni (leaves) indicates that the Vedas are the protecting and nourishing canopy of the cosmic tree — they preserve dharma. The Ācāryas uniformly interpret 'yas taṃ veda sa veda-vit' as meaning: one who truly comprehends this metaphor in its full depth — grasping that the cosmos has its ultimate root in the Imperishable — has grasped the very heart of Vedic knowledge."

        "dadaji": "The tree of saṃsāra grows in every direction — upward into the divine worlds, downward into lower realms — sustained entirely by the three guṇas, the creative energies of nature. And what are its tender, alluring sprouts? The sense-objects — the sights, sounds, tastes, and touches that draw the mind outward. Dadaji would remind us gently: it is our karma, accumulated through countless births, that forms the secondary roots binding us to this human world. Every selfish action adds another root. Yet notice that the Lord describes all this without condemnation — it is the display of His own nature, and understanding it fully is itself a step toward freedom.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse elaborates the anatomy of saṃsāra with Vedāntic precision. The branches extending in all directions represent the multiplicity of beings in all worlds — higher (devas, pitṛs) and lower (animals, hells) — all nourished and sustained by the interplay of sattva, rajas, and tamas. The sense-objects as 'pravāla' (new shoots) is revealing: they appear fresh, attractive, and inviting — yet they are merely the newest growth on a very old tree. The secondary roots growing downward into the human world bound by karma indicate that it is in human birth especially that karma accumulates or is dissolved. The entire teaching points to the urgent need for viveka — discriminative intelligence.",
        "yogananda": "The tree of cosmic manifestation ramifies in every direction — into high and low states of consciousness, into refined and gross levels of experience — and it is the three guṇas, the cosmic forces of light, activity, and inertia, that act as the sap feeding every branch. The sense-objects that glitter and call to us at the tips of the branches are the newest, most delicate shoots of this great tree — tempting, ephemeral, nourishing perhaps, but never the essence. The karmic roots binding humanity in the world of action are the result of accumulated desire and deed — the very system by which the soul ties itself ever more tightly to the wheel of birth and rebirth. Yoga is the practice of withdrawing from the shoots and tracing our way back to the root in God.",
        "goyandka": "The second verse completes the description of the cosmic Aśvattha by detailing its extension. The upward branches correspond to the subtler, higher lokas (worlds) where beings of greater sattva dwell; the downward branches correspond to the grosser realms. The critical phrase is 'guṇa-pravṛddhāḥ' — it is the three guṇas that sustain and expand the entire tree of phenomenal existence. The secondary roots in the human world 'karmānubandhīni' are particularly significant: the śāstric teaching is that it is in manuṣya-loka (the human realm) that karma is primarily generated and also primarily dissolved through jñāna and bhakti. This dual possibility — bondage and liberation — is unique to human birth."

        "dadaji": "This verse reveals something profound and humbling: the tree of this world cannot be truly comprehended from within it — you cannot see its beginning, its end, or its true foundation while standing inside it. This is the paradox of saṃsāra. But the Lord immediately gives us the remedy: take up the weapon of asaṅga — non-attachment, non-clinging — and cut it with firm, resolute strokes. Dadaji would say: the axe is not aggression but clarity. Asaṅga is not coldness — it is freedom. When we stop clinging to the tree, we can finally see it for what it is. Verses 3 and 4 together form one complete instruction — the command and its fruit.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The Vedāntic insight here is critical: saṃsāra cannot be understood from within saṃsāra — its true form (rūpa), its beginning (ādi), its end (anta), and its ultimate ground (sampratiṣṭhā) are all imperceptible to the ordinary bound intellect. This is precisely the nature of māyā — it conceals itself. The prescription is equally clear and direct: cut the tree with asaṅga-śastra. Asaṅga — non-attachment — is the sharpest weapon in the Vedāntic arsenal because saṃsāra is sustained by attachment. When attachment is severed by the sword of vairāgya and viveka, the tree of saṃsāra loses its power to bind. This is the beginning of verse-3, which is completed by verse-4.",
        "yogananda": "How beautifully the Lord acknowledges that the cosmic tree of existence cannot be grasped by the intellect operating from within — its form shifts, its beginning is lost in the mists of creation, its end is invisible, its true foundation cannot be found through ordinary means. This is the confession that saṃsāra is ultimately mysterious to the ego-bound mind. The sword of non-attachment is the inner renunciation that the yogi must forge — not a sword of metal, but of discrimination. 'Su-virūḍha-mūlam' — the roots are deeply, deeply entrenched in the soil of habit, desire, and ego-identification. It takes a firm, practiced hand to cut them. But the Lord assures us: it can be done.",
        "goyandka": "Verses 3 and 4 constitute a single grammatical and philosophical unit. The first half (v3) establishes the epistemological point: the cosmic tree of saṃsāra does not reveal its true nature to sense perception — it has no visible beginning, end, or self-evident foundation. This corresponds to the ānādi nature of māyā in Advaita and the beginningless bondage taught across all Vedāntic schools. The remedy prescribed — asaṅga-śastra — is the weapon of vairāgya (dispassion), described as 'dṛḍha' (firm), indicating that it must be a steady, cultivated dispassion, not a momentary detachment. The 'su-virūḍha-mūlam' acknowledges the deep entrenchment of saṃsāric tendencies (vāsanās) that must be uprooted."

The Lord says with great tenderness: seek that State from which there is no return — and then He models the very path by saying 'I take refuge in the Primal Puruṣa.' Prapadye — I surrender. Even the Lord speaks the language of surrender and love! Dadaji would say this is the most beautiful moment: after all the philosophical architecture, the answer is prapadye — simply fall into the arms of that One from whom all creation has flowed. The ancient river of existence has its source in Him. Return to the source. This is the whole teaching.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse completes the grammatical sentence begun in verse 3 and delivers the Vedāntic climax: after renunciation comes the positive quest — parimārgitavyam, earnestly seek that State (tat padam) from which there is no return. The 'no return' (na nivartanti) is the Gita's definition of mokṣa — the irreversible recognition of one's identity with Brahman. Most strikingly, the Lord uses 'prapadye' — first person, present tense — 'I take refuge.' Even the Īśvara, speaking as the teacher, points beyond Himself to the Primal Source. This is the Gita's non-dual depth: the personal God points to the impersonal Absolute as the ground of all, including Himself.",
        "yogananda": "The goal is now stated with crystalline clarity: seek that State — tat padam — from which the liberated soul never returns to the cycle of birth and death. And the means is equally clear: prapadye — total, wholehearted surrender to the Primal Puruṣa, the Cosmic Source from whom the entire river of creation has been flowing since the beginning of time. Surrender is not weakness — it is the most direct route home. When the soul stops insisting on its own direction and simply falls into the current of the Divine, it finds itself carried back to the Ocean from which it came. This is the guru's teaching and the Lord's own example.",
        "goyandka": "Verse 4 completes the instruction of verse 3 and forms the positive counterpart to the renunciation enjoined there. The phrase 'parimārgitavyam' uses the gerundive form, denoting an imperative — it must be sought. The qualification of the Goal as that from which 'na nivartanti bhūyaḥ' (one does not return again) distinguishes mokṣa from the temporary heavenly states described in earlier chapters, from which souls do return. The use of 'prapadye' — 'I take refuge' — is theologically significant: the Lord Himself models the attitude of prapatti (surrender) before the Eternal, indicating that even within the Bhagavān-jīva relationship, the ultimate ground is the Puruṣottama described in the climactic verses of this chapter."

        "dadaji": "The Lord now describes the beautiful qualifications of those who walk freely toward liberation — and notice that He begins not with great austerities or intellectual feats, but with freedom from pride (māna) and delusion (moha). These are the inner veils that obscure the Divine. When pride falls away, the heart opens; when delusion clears, the Lord is everywhere visible. 'Adhyātma-nityāḥ' — they are constantly absorbed in the awareness of the inner Self. This is the life of unbroken remembrance that Dadaji always pointed to. Desires are turned back, opposites no longer toss them about — and so they walk, undeluded, straight into the Imperishable.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse lists six precise qualifications for those who attain tat padam avyayam — the Imperishable State. From a Vedāntic perspective, the progression is systematic: first, freedom from pride and delusion (which constitute the ahaṅkāra-complex); then, conquest of saṅga (attachment, the root of bondage); then, adhyātma-nityatā (constant abidance in the Ātman — this is nididhyāsana, sustained Self-inquiry); then, withdrawal of desires; then, freedom from dvandvas. The final quality — amūḍha — is the natural result of all the others: delusion simply cannot persist once these six qualities are present. These are not goals to be achieved sequentially but facets of the same inner freedom.",
        "yogananda": "Here the Lord paints a portrait of the liberated soul — serene, untouched by vanity, undisturbed by attachment, anchored always in the awareness of the inner Self. 'Adhyātma-nityāḥ' — this phrase captures the essence of the yogi's life: every moment, in every situation, the awareness is turned inward to the Self that is ever-present, ever-blissful, ever-free. When desires are withdrawn from the senses and the pairs of opposites no longer create inner weather, the soul walks in a kind of perpetual sunshine. The word 'amūḍhāḥ' — undeluded — is the master word: it is confusion, not circumstance, that keeps us from the Imperishable. Remove the confusion, and liberation is here, now.",
        "goyandka": "This verse is the qualification-verse for the goal stated in verse 4. The Ācāryas note that these six qualities — nirmāna-moha, jita-saṅga-doṣa, adhyātma-nityatā, vinivṛtta-kāmatā, dvandva-vimuktatā, and amūḍhatva — constitute the sādhana-saptaka in miniature. 'Jita-saṅga-doṣa' is particularly important: saṅga (attachment) is called a 'doṣa' (fault, defect), indicating that it is a distortion of the natural state of the puruṣa, not its essence. 'Adhyātma-nityā' corresponds to the constant brahma-vicāra of the jñāna-mārga. The compound 'sukha-duḥkha-saṃjñaiḥ dvandvaiḥ' specifies that it is the experiential dvandvas — felt as pleasure and pain — that the sādhaka must transcend."

'Tad dhāma paramaṃ mama' — that Supreme Radiance is Mine, says the Lord, with quiet majesty.

Those who find it do not need to search again.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This is one of the most celebrated verses of the Gita, echoing the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad (2.2.10) and the Kaṭha Upaniṣad (5.15) almost verbatim: 'na tatra sūryo bhāti na candra-tārakam, nemā vidyuto bhānti, kuto'yam agniḥ — tam eva bhāntam anubhāti sarvaṃ, tasya bhāsā sarvam idaṃ vibhāti.' The supreme Self is self-luminous (svayam-prakāśa) — it does not depend on any external source of illumination because it is itself the ground of all light, all perception, all knowing. The statement 'tad dhāma paramaṃ mama' is the Lord's personal claim on the Absolute — the Saguṇa Brahman identifying Himself with the Nirguṇa Brahman in an act of supreme teaching.",
        "yogananda": "This luminous verse describes the inner kingdom that the great mystics of all ages have entered — the realm of pure Self-luminous Consciousness where the instruments of the outer world (sun, moon, fire) have no jurisdiction. In deep samādhi the yogi enters this inner sun — a light that illumines the sun itself! The great saints have reported this experience: a light beyond all lights, a peace surpassing understanding, a joy with no cause. 'Tad dhāma paramaṃ mama' — the Lord says this is His home. And since we are, as He will say in verse 7, a fragment of Him, it is our home too. The prodigal souls are being called home.",

The Lord here identifies His own supreme dhāma with the self-luminous Brahman of the Upaniṣads. Three instruments of cosmic illumination are named — the sun (lord of the day), the moon (lord of the night), and Agni/fire (lord of earthly light and ritual) — and all three are declared incapable of illumining that Abode. This establishes that the Supreme cannot be an object of perception; it is the subject, the witness, the light of all lights. The verse is cited by all Ācāryas as proof that the Lord's 'parama dhāma' is identical with the nirguṇa Brahman."

Not separate, not forgotten, not abandoned — a living, eternal portion of the Divine, here in this world of jīvas. The beauty is in 'sanātanaḥ' — this fragment is not new, not temporary, not created at birth. It is eternal. Dadaji would say: this is why the soul can never truly be at peace with anything less than the Lord Himself — because it is His own part, and the part longs for the whole. The senses pull outward, but the soul's deepest pull is always inward, toward its Source.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is the cornerstone of the Viśiṣṭādvaita theology of Rāmānuja and also deeply significant in Advaita interpretation. 'Mamaivāṃśaḥ' — an aṃśa (fragment/portion) of the Lord — is the jīva. The eternal (sanātana) nature of the jīva-as-fragment is important: the individual soul is not a product of Prakṛti or a temporary confusion — it is an eternal reality related to Brahman. The jīva in its present condition is 'karṣati' — pulling the senses and mind toward itself, being driven by Prakṛti. The Advaitic reading notes that the 'fragment' metaphor ultimately points to non-difference: you cannot have a true fragment of the infinite — the jīva's apparent individuality is the superimposition of avidyā upon the one Ātman.",
        "yogananda": "God, the Infinite, has not merely created us from outside Himself — He has sent a ray of His own being into each form. 'Mamaivāṃśaḥ' — My very own portion, My own self in miniature, dwelling as the jīva in this world. This is a truth that, when felt and not merely understood, dissolves all sense of alienation, all fear, all existential loneliness. You are a wave of the Cosmic Ocean — as long as the wave forgets the ocean, it experiences itself as separate, tossed by the winds of the guṇas, dragging the senses around in search of satisfaction. When the wave remembers its nature, it relaxes into its Source. This is the whole spiritual journey in one verse.",
        "goyandka": "This verse establishes the ontological status of the jīva in the Gita's own teaching. 'Mama eva aṃśaḥ' — the emphatic 'eva' (alone, only) indicates the inseparability of the jīva from the Lord, even while the 'aṃśa' (portion) language maintains a distinction for teaching purposes. 'Sanātanaḥ' establishes that the jīva is not a new creation — it is beginningless, consistent with the Gita's teaching in chapter 2 that the ātmā is eternal. The compound 'manaḥ-ṣaṣṭhāni indriyāṇi' identifies the subtle body complex: the five jñānendriya (ear, eye, skin, tongue, nose) plus manas (the processing mind). This subtle body is what the jīva 'draws' — and it is what migrates from birth to birth, as the next verse will explain."

The jīva, the lord of the body, leaves its old home carrying the subtle fragrance of all its experiences, all its loves, all its impressions — and moves on to receive a new form. Dadaji would say: death is simply the wind moving on. The fragrance — the soul, the subtle body, the accumulated saṃskāras — does not disappear; it is simply carried forward. This verse gives great comfort: nothing essential is lost. But it also gives urgency: the fragrance we carry forward is shaped by what we cultivate here and now.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse provides the Gita's elegant explanation of metempsychosis — the transmigration of the jīva. The jīva is called 'īśvaraḥ' (lord) because within the context of the body, it is the presiding intelligence. When it departs, it carries the 'liṅga-śarīra' — the subtle body consisting of the senses and mind mentioned in verse 7 — to its next embodiment. The wind-and-fragrance simile (vāyu-gandha) is philosophically precise: the wind (jīva) is imperceptible but its movement is revealed by what it carries; the fragrance (subtle body and saṃskāras) is invisible yet real. The jīva itself cannot be seen, but its presence is known through the expressions of the subtle body it bears.",
        "yogananda": "The ancient teaching of reincarnation is here expressed in the most lyrical simile of the entire Gita — the soul departing like a wind carrying fragrance. What a gracious way to describe what the materialist sees as mere death! The soul carries its unseen cargo of mental impressions, unfulfilled desires, spiritual attainments, and saṃskāras — its fragrance — from one embodiment to the next. The quality of that fragrance depends entirely on the flowers the soul has spent time with. If it has dwelt in the garden of divine consciousness, it carries the fragrance of God. If it has roamed through the markets of sense-gratification, it carries those scents instead. Choose your garden wisely, says this verse.",
        "goyandka": "This verse directly addresses the mechanics of rebirth (punarjanma), which the Gita affirms throughout. The jīva is called 'īśvara' — the controller, the presiding consciousness — because in relation to the body it governs, it is indeed the master. The simile of vāyu (wind) carrying gandhān (fragrances) from āśayāt (their source/resting place) is chosen with great care: the wind takes the smell but leaves the flower; the soul takes the subtle impressions but leaves the gross body. 'Gṛhītvā etāni saṃyāti' — having taken these (senses and mind), it departs. This is precisely the sūkṣma-śarīra (subtle body) described in the Sāṃkhya and Vedāntic systems as the vehicle of transmigration."

Dadaji would say: there is nothing wrong with this experience in itself — the Lord has given us these faculties as gifts, as windows through which the beauty of His creation can be received. The senses are not enemies. It is only when the jīva forgets that it is 'adhiṣṭhāya' — the presiding master — and instead becomes enslaved to the senses that saṃsāra deepens. The master who forgets he is the master and starts serving the servants — that is the human predicament.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse completes the picture of verses 7 and 8 by showing how the jīva functions within embodied existence. The five jñānendriyas (ear, eye, skin, tongue, nose) plus manas constitute the complete set of experiential faculties, and the jīva 'adhiṣṭhāya' — presides over — all of them. This is the Vedāntic teaching that Consciousness is the substratum of all perception: the eyes do not truly see; the ears do not truly hear — it is Consciousness, functioning through these instruments, that perceives. The word 'adhiṣṭhāya' is crucial: the jīva is the master, not the instrument. Yet in practice, through avidyā, the master forgets its mastery and becomes identified with the instruments — and that is bondage.",
        "yogananda": "Here the Lord maps the extraordinary mechanism of human experience: five sense organs and the mind, all presided over by the soul. The soul is the electricity that animates the whole system — without it, all six faculties are inert. 'Adhiṣṭhāya' — sitting as the master above — is the soul's true relationship to the senses. Yet how often the soul descends from its throne and runs after the objects the senses report! The entire spiritual life could be described as the practice of reclaiming the throne — restoring the soul to its rightful position as master of the senses rather than their servant. Meditation is the royal road to this restoration.",
        "goyandka": "This verse enumerates the five jñānendriyas (cognitive senses) — śrotra (hearing), cakṣus (sight), sparśana (touch), rasana (taste), ghrāṇa (smell) — and adds manas (mind) as the sixth, consistent with verse 7. The term 'adhiṣṭhāya' (presiding over) is technically precise: in Sāṃkhya-Vedānta, the jīva is the adhiṣṭhātā (presiding consciousness) of the sense-organ complex; the senses themselves are material instruments (aparā prakṛti). 'Viṣayān upasevate' — the jīva 'serves' or 'attends upon' sense-objects — the word 'upasevate' implies a kind of attendance or service relationship, subtly pointing out the reversal: the master has begun serving the servants, the jīva has become subordinate to the objects of the senses."

        "dadaji": "This verse draws a clear and compassionate distinction between the two kinds of people in this world: the vimūḍha, who moves through life and death without perceiving the soul that is the actor behind it all — and the jñāna-cakṣuṣa, whose inner eye is open and who sees the soul in all its states. Dadaji would say: the difference is not intelligence but attention. The deluded person's attention is always on the objects — the fragrances, not the wind that carries them. The wise person's attention rests on the Ātman — the wind itself, the light itself, the awareness itself. This inner sight, jñāna-cakṣus, is what satsaṅga, meditation, and the guru's grace slowly open within us.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The verse describes three states of the jīva — utkrāmanta (departing the body), sthita (residing in the body), and bhuñjāna (experiencing through the body) — and declares that the ordinary person, 'vimūḍha' (greatly deluded), cannot perceive the subtle soul in any of these states. This is the blindness caused by avidyā: the person sees the death of the body but cannot perceive the departure of the jīva; they see someone awake and active but cannot perceive the silent witness-consciousness behind the activity. 'Jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ' — those with the eye of discriminative wisdom — see precisely what the deluded miss: the eternal Ātman moving through all these states untouched, like a witness.",
        "yogananda": "How many millions of people have watched a loved one depart this world and yet seen nothing but the collapse of the physical form — not perceiving the luminous soul that rose from it like fragrance from a flower! And how many live their entire lives without once directly perceiving the soul within themselves — that silent, luminous witness behind all thought and sensation! The Lord calls such people 'vimūḍha' — not with contempt but with compassion — because delusion is simply the absence of light. The ones who see are those who have cultivated the inner eye of jñāna through meditation, satsaṅga, and sincere inquiry. That inner eye, once opened, cannot be closed again.",
        "goyandka": "This verse brings the first section of Chapter 15 to a close with a fundamental epistemological statement: the soul — in its three conditions of transmigrating (utkrāmanta), residing in a body (sthita), and experiencing sense-objects (bhuñjāna) — is invisible to the 'vimūḍha' (the one in whom viveka is absent) precisely because it is 'guṇānvita' (associated with the guṇas). The guṇas act as a concealing veil: the play of sattva, rajas, and tamas in the body-mind complex obscures the pure Consciousness that underlies it. The 'jñāna-cakṣuṣaḥ' — those equipped with the eye of Ātma-vicāra (Self-inquiry) — perceive the eternal jīva-svarūpa shining through all states. This sets up the Lord's further revelation of the Kṣara-Akṣara-Puruṣottama triad in the verses that follow."

        "dadaji": "Beloved, the Lord here reveals a tender and important truth: effort alone is not enough — the heart must also be purified. The yogin who has lovingly worked on himself, surrendering ego and desire, finds the Ātman shining within like a lamp in a clean room. But one who strives with an impure mind is like a person searching for the sun with eyes full of dust. Dear seeker, let your sādhana be not only vigorous but also cleansing — so that when you look within, the Lord's own light greets you.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "From the Advaita standpoint, the Ātman is ever self-luminous and self-evident — it is not something to be attained but recognized. The distinction here is subtle: both the yogin and the akṛtātmān strive, yet only one sees. The difference is antaḥkaraṇa-śuddhi — purity of the inner instrument. The mind purified through ethical discipline, dispassion, and meditation becomes transparent, and the Ātman, which was always present as pure Awareness, is recognized directly. The unpurified mind superimposes objects and agitations, obscuring the very Awareness it seeks.",
        "yogananda": "The inner eye of intuition — the spiritual eye of which Christ spoke — opens only when the turbulence of ego, desire, and restlessness has been stilled through sustained yoga practice. The yogin referenced here is not merely a physical practitioner but one who has interiorized all faculties and directed them Godward. The akṛtātmān, despite external effort, has not yet turned the searchlight of attention away from the senses and inward to the spine and brain, where God's presence is directly felt. Purification of the nervous system and the subtle body through Kriyā-like techniques is the indispensable preparation.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Śaṅkarācārya glosses 'akṛtātmānaḥ' as those who have not cultivated the inner self through the practices of śama (mental restraint), dama (sense restraint), and the other sādhana-catuṣṭaya. Mere intellectual striving or external ritual cannot substitute for this inner work. 'Acetasaḥ' points to the absence of a refined cetanā — a consciousness sharpened by viveka and vairāgya. The scriptural injunction thus is clear: before embarking on the inquiry into the Self, one must prepare the ground through the prescribed spiritual disciplines as outlined in Vedāntic tradition."

When the gentle moon soothes the night with silver coolness, that nourishing grace is His. The fire that warms and transforms — again, His tejas.

        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse initiates the Lord's vibhūti-yoga within Chapter 15, tracing all cosmic luminosity back to its ultimate source in Brahman. The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad declares: 'Na tatra sūryo bhāti na candra-tārakam' — the sun does not shine there, nor the moon, nor the stars; by the light of Brahman alone do all these shine. The Lord here echoes that śruti: the tejas of the sun, moon, and fire is not independent but derivative. Brahman alone is self-luminous (svayaṃprakāśa); everything else is luminous only by borrowing that primordial light.",
        "yogananda": "Science tells us that all energy in the solar system flows from the sun — but what is the source of the sun's energy? The Lord here reveals the metaphysical truth: the cosmic energy behind all light is divine. In meditation, when prana is withdrawn from the senses and focused at the spiritual eye, the meditator perceives an inner light far more luminous than sunlight — the inner sun of the Ātman. This is not metaphor; it is direct experience. The visible light of sun, moon, and fire are outer reflections of that inner divine luminosity which the Lord here claims as His own.",
        "goyandka": "The Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2.2.15) is the scriptural backdrop: 'Tameva bhāntam anubhāti sarvaṃ, tasya bhāsā sarvam idaṃ vibhāti' — by His light alone does everything shine; by His luminosity all this is illumined. The Lord here makes explicit in the Gītā what the Upaniṣads state more abstractly. 'Viddhi māmakam' — the imperative to know is instructive: this is not a fact to be accepted intellectually but a truth to be continuously contemplated as part of one's jñāna-abhyāsa. The meditator on this verse gradually dissolves the illusion that light belongs to objects and recognizes the one luminous Ātman."

In Vedic cosmology, the moon is the source of the vegetative principle. The Vedāntic insight is that behind both the gross physical moon and the subtle principle of rasa stands the one Brahman — here declaring 'I am that.'",
        "yogananda": "The human body is largely water, and every cell depends on the lunar cycles, the tides of prāṇa, and the nourishing life-force the Vedic seers called soma. When we eat a fruit or a grain, we are consuming stored sunlight and moonlight — stored divine energy. In deep meditation, the yogi perceives this life-force (prāṇa) as a luminous current sustaining the body from within. The Lord here reveals that the very same cosmic intelligence that directs the growth of a blade of grass also sustains the cells of the meditator's body. All nourishment, at its deepest level, is divine grace.",

'Ojas' in the Āyurvedic tradition is the subtlest essence of the seven dhātus — the vital vitality that holds the body and its functions in coherence. That the Lord enters the earth (prithvī-tattva) and supports beings through this subtlest energy is a teaching about the Antaryāmin being the true sustainer behind all physical processes. Similarly, the moon's role in nourishing vegetation through its gravitational and subtle influences is here credited to the Lord's own presence as Soma."

Vaiśvānara — the universal fire within all creatures — is the Lord Himself. Next time you eat, dear one, feel that the Lord inside you is accepting the offering of food. The Gītā in Chapter 4 calls this a yajña — the offering of food into the fire of Brahman. Now you see why: the fire receiving the offering is the Lord Himself.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The Chāndogya Upaniṣad (5.18.1) identifies Vaiśvānara as the cosmic Self in the context of the pañcāgni-vidyā (doctrine of five fires). Here the same teaching is made personal: every digestive fire in every creature is the Lord's own presence. The Vedāntic significance is that the innermost life-processes — breathing, digesting, the coordination of prāṇa and apāna — are not mechanical but are the Lord's own activity. There is no level of existence, not even biological, where the divine is absent. This is the Advaitic vision of the Lord as the material and efficient cause of all.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda taught that prāṇa — the life-force — is the mediator between consciousness and matter. The interplay of prāṇa and apāna described here corresponds to the subtle energy currents that yogis learn to control through prāṇāyāma. When a yogi masters these currents, he becomes aware of the divine fire burning within — not as metaphor but as direct experience of the Vaiśvānara. The four kinds of food are sustained by this fire, but the ultimate nourishment, Yogananda taught, is prāṇic — the yogi who can draw energy from divine sources requires less material food.",
        "goyandka": "The four varieties of food (catur-vidha anna) are enumerated in the traditional commentaries as: bhojya (chewed, as grains), bhakṣya (that which is bitten off in pieces), lehya (that which is licked), and peyya (that which is drunk). These cover the full range of nutrition the body requires. The Vaiśvānara fire, energized by the twin prāṇic forces of inhalation and exhalation, transforms all of these into life-sustaining nourishment. This verse firmly establishes the Lord as the direct sustaining principle within biological life — beyond being merely a distant creator."

        "dadaji": "Here the Lord reveals Himself as the Antaryāmin — the Inner Ruler seated in the very heart of every being. From Him comes the memory that connects our past to our present, the jñāna that reveals the ultimate truth, and even the merciful apohana — the divine grace of forgetting what is no longer needed for our growth. And then He says with great tenderness: 'I am what all the Vedas seek to reveal.' The entire scripture, all eighteen thousand verses of the Vedas, all the Upaniṣads — all are pointing their finger toward this One who sits in your own heart. Dear devotee, you need go no further than within.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This is perhaps the most philosophically rich verse of the chapter. 'Hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ' — the Antaryāmin of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 'He who dwells within the heart, yet the heart does not know.' The three gifts — smṛti, jñāna, apohana — are interpreted by Śaṅkara as: the memory that enables functional cognition, the liberating knowledge that dispels ignorance, and the removal of both (transcendence of the mind-knowledge complex in samādhi). 'Vedānta-kṛt' — the Lord as the source of the Upaniṣadic teaching confirms Advaita's position that śruti is an impersonal revelation of the nature of Brahman.",
        "yogananda": "In this verse, the Lord reveals the mechanics of inner spiritual development: memory, insight, and ultimately transcendence all flow from the same divine source seated within. The great saints across traditions have reported this same experience — a sense of inner guidance, of knowledge arising from a source deeper than the intellect. Yogananda described the Antaryāmin as accessible through deep meditation at the heart center, where — when the devotee is sufficiently still — the Lord communicates directly as intuition. The 'removal' (apohana) is the final grace: the dissolution of even the meditator's mind into God-consciousness.",
        "goyandka": "The compound 'vedānta-kṛt' bears two important interpretations in the commentarial tradition. Śaṅkarācārya takes it as the author of the Vedānta (Upaniṣads), reinforcing that the Lord is the source of all śruti. Madhvācārya and others take it as the establisher of the Brahma-sūtras. Both interpretations converge on a single point: the Lord is not merely a figure described in scripture but the very source from which scripture arises. He is simultaneously the subject of all Vedic knowledge (vedya), its author (vedānta-kṛt), and its knower (veda-vit) — a perfect, self-referential circle of divine self-disclosure."

        "dadaji": "The Lord now presents us with a great map of Reality — two vast categories of existence. Kṣara is the entire world of beings, forms, names, and changes — everything that arises and passes. Akṣara is the unchanging ground, like an anvil that remains perfectly still even as the hammer strikes. The beloved Lord is preparing us for the great revelation of the next verse: that He Himself is beyond even this unchanging ground. But first, He asks us to contemplate these two — to see the world as kṣara and to seek the akṣara within our own depths.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse introduces the ontological framework for the Puruṣottama doctrine. The Kṣara corresponds to the vyākṛta — the manifested, name-and-form world — including all individual jīvas bound in saṃsāra. The Akṣara is the avyākṛta, the Unmanifest — the primordial Prakṛti of Sāṃkhya or the Māyā-śakti of Advaita, which persists as the unchanging substratum through all cycles of creation and dissolution. The word 'kūṭa-sthaḥ' — literally 'standing like a mountain peak' or 'like an anvil' — implies absolute immovability. This distinction is critical: even the 'unchanging' ground of phenomenal existence is still a lower order of reality than the Uttama Puruṣa revealed in v17.",
        "yogananda": "In the language of yogic cosmology, the Kṣara represents the entire field of māyā — the vibratory creation with all its beings caught in the cycle of birth and death. The Akṣara represents the cosmic causal body — the primordial matrix of unmanifested consciousness from which the universe periodically emerges. Even in the individual, there is the changing personality (kṣara) and the deeper, relatively unchanging causal body (akṣara). But the Lord here prepares us for a higher truth: He transcends both. True liberation lies not in reaching the causal plane but in realizing the Puruṣottama beyond it.",
        "goyandka": "Classical Vedāntic commentaries identify the Kṣara with the jīva-rāśi — the collective of all individual souls bound to prakṛti through the five sheaths (pañcakośas). The Akṣara is identified with avyakta — the primordial, unmanifested state of prakṛti which, though not empirically active, persists as the ground of manifestation. Some commentators following Rāmānuja identify Akṣara with the liberated souls (mukta-jīvas) in Vaikuṇṭha, who are eternal and unchanging in their blessed state. All schools agree that both are transcended by the Uttama Puruṣa of the following verse."

Śaṅkara interprets this as: Kṣara = jīvas, Akṣara = Māyā, Uttama Puruṣa = Nirguṇa Brahman. Rāmānuja interprets: Kṣara = bound souls, Akṣara = liberated souls, Uttama = Nārāyaṇa.

The Paramātman — the Cosmic Intelligence that animates and sustains every atom in the three planes of existence — is here identified as the Uttama Puruṣa.

This is not a philosophical abstraction — it is the direct experience of Paramātman that great saints have reported through the ages. The Lord is telling Arjuna: 'That which the greatest yogis attain — that is I.'",

The Uttama Puruṣa is not merely the greatest of the two or the synthesis of both — He is categorically 'anyaḥ,' different, transcendent. 'Loka-trayam āviśya bibharti' — entering and sustaining the three worlds — echoes the Puruṣa-sūkta of the Ṛg Veda, where the cosmic Puruṣa pervades all of creation.

This is not arrogance but gracious self-revelation so that the devotee may know fully Whom he worships.

The title 'Puruṣottama' appears rarely in the Upaniṣads but becomes a central theological term in the Gītā. Its meaning here is precise: not 'the best Puruṣa among many' but 'the one who transcends the very category of Puruṣa as defined by the Kṣara/Akṣara division.' He is uttama — highest — not in a relative sense but absolutely, standing outside any comparative framework. 'Loke vede ca prathitaḥ' — celebrated in both the world (popular tradition) and the Vedas (scriptural tradition) — grounds the title in both lived devotion and śāstric authority.",

Yogananda taught that the names of God, when chanted with understanding and devotion, carry the actual divine presence. Here the Lord reveals the meaning behind the name He bears in the eternal tradition — a name that synthesizes the entire metaphysical framework of the chapter. To know that the Lord one worships transcends both the relative world and the absolute ground is to worship with full philosophical clarity and unreserved devotion. Partial understanding leads to partial surrender; complete understanding — knowing Him as Puruṣottama — enables total surrender.",
        "goyandka": "The word 'prathitaḥ' — celebrated, well known — is important. The Lord does not say 'I declare Myself' but 'I am known / celebrated.' This is an appeal to the universal recognition of this truth in both Vedic literature and in the hearts of the wise across ages. The Nārāyaṇīya section of the Mahābhārata, the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, and the Upaniṣads all use derivatives of this title. Puruṣottama is thus not a private claim but a universally recognized revelation — the convergence of scriptural testimony and the direct experience of seers about the nature of the Supreme."

Not because he has memorized all facts, but because knowing the Source of all, he knows all that truly matters. And what happens to such a one? He worships with sarva-bhāvena — with his whole being, every breath, every thought, every action becoming an act of worship. This is the natural flowering of true jñāna into perfect bhakti. Knowledge of the Supreme does not lead to cold detachment — it leads to wholehearted, joyful, complete surrender in love.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The correlation drawn here between jñāna and bhakti is philosophically significant and points toward Vedānta's integral vision. 'Asammūḍhaḥ' — undeluded — is the prerequisite: clear discrimination (viveka) about the true nature of the Lord as Puruṣottama. 'Sarva-vid' — knowing the Absolute, one knows the ground of all, and thus knows 'all' in the most essential sense. Then — not instead of devotion but as its fullest expression — 'sarva-bhāvena bhajati': worships with every state of being. The Narada Bhakti Sūtras describe this as 'sarvārpaṇa' — total offering. The jñāni and the bhakta meet here in the highest state.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda often said that the goal of all spiritual practice is to 'know God and know yourself' — and here the Lord confirms that knowing Him as Puruṣottama is the culmination of all knowing. 'Sarva-bhāvena' — Yogananda translated this as 'in all the ways of loving': with the devotion of a child, a friend, a servant, a beloved. When the intellectual recognition of the Puruṣottama is fully integrated, it spontaneously ignites all-encompassing love. The mind no longer seeks anything outside God; every moment becomes worship. This is the state of paramabhakti — the supreme devotion the Gītā has been building toward throughout.",
        "goyandka": "The use of 'evam' (thus — in the manner declared in verses 16-18) is crucial: this is not generic knowledge of a Supreme Being but specific, articulate understanding of the three-Puruṣa framework and the Lord's unique status as Puruṣottama. This precision of understanding (viveka-jñāna) is what qualifies one as 'asammūḍha' — free from the delusion that confuses the Lord with the Kṣara world or even with the Akṣara ground. Upon this foundation of clear jñāna, the bhakti that arises is not sentimental but firmly rooted — sarva-bhāvena, comprehensive, unwavering, and utterly complete."

        "dadaji": "The Lord concludes this sacred chapter with the most tender benediction. He calls Arjuna 'Anagha' — sinless one — as if to say, 'You are already pure, my dear; this wisdom is for you.' And then He promises: understand this, and you become buddhimān — truly wise — and kṛta-kṛtyaḥ — one who has done everything that needed to be done. There is nothing more to seek, nowhere else to go. The one who truly knows Puruṣottama has arrived Home. This is the Lord's promise at the close of His most secret chapter: receive this teaching in your heart and be fulfilled.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The phrase 'guhyatamaṃ śāstram' — the most secret scripture — is a remarkable claim. The Lord does not say 'this verse' or 'this topic' but 'this śāstram' — this complete teaching forms, in itself, a scripture of the highest order. Śaṅkara notes that its secrecy lies not in concealment but in its subtlety: this teaching about the three Puruṣas and the supremacy of the Puruṣottama cannot be grasped by the uninitiated. 'Kṛta-kṛtyaḥ' — this compound is the Vedic formula for complete fulfillment: all ṛṇas (debts) paid, all goals achieved, all duties discharged. The knower of Puruṣottama has transcended the entire framework of duty and debt.",
        "yogananda": "Every great scripture closes with a benediction, and here the Lord's closing words carry enormous power: 'know this and be free.' The chapter began with the cosmic tree of saṃsāra — inverted, hard to see, rooted in Brahman — and ends here with the direct revelation of Brahman as Puruṣottama seated in every heart. The journey from the entangled cosmic tree to the free recognition of the Supreme Person in one's own heart — that is Chapter 15. 'Buddhimān syāt' — one becomes truly intelligent. Worldly intelligence accumulates facts; divine intelligence knows the one Fact from which all others derive their meaning.",
        "goyandka": "The closing of Chapter 15 with the declaration 'guhyatamaṃ śāstram' reflects the Vedic tradition of self-referential statements within sacred texts. The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad similarly concludes by calling itself the means to the highest liberation. Here the Lord asserts the unique status of this fifteen-chapter teaching as a self-contained revelatory scripture on the Supreme — more esoteric than the karma-yoga of early chapters, more direct than the bhakti-yoga passages. 'Kṛta-kṛtyaḥ ca bhārata' — the final words — echo the Taittirīya Upaniṣad's declaration of the knower of Brahman: 'He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman.' All seeking ceases in the fullness of this knowing."
