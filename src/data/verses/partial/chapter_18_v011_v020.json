        "dadaji": "Dadaji often emphasized that the body itself is an instrument of dharma, and so long as we wear it, actions are inevitable — breathing, digesting, speaking, serving. The real question is never whether to act but whether we act as slaves to the fruit or as free servants of the Divine. He who lets go of the craving for results is the true tyāgī in Dadaji's eyes: not the hermit in the cave, but the mother who labors without counting the cost, the devotee who chants without asking for reward. This verse closes the opening argument of Chapter 18 with a practical, compassionate definition — tyāga is an inner stance, not an outer withdrawal.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that this verse delivers the Gita's conclusive and operational definition of tyāga. The objection 'but can I really renounce all action?' is met head-on: no, while embodied you cannot, and the Gita does not ask you to. What you can and must renounce is the psychological grip of phala — the anxious, ego-driven craving for outcomes. The karma-phala-tyāgī acts fully, even heroically, but the fruits are offered back to the source. This is what Vedanta calls nishkāma karma — desire-free action — and it is the highway to liberation for the householder and seeker alike.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda taught that the body is a divine instrument lent to the soul for its earthly mission, and therefore activity is the soul's curriculum, not its prison. To stop all action prematurely is to walk out of class. The wise student completes every assignment — every duty, every service, every creative work — without grabbing at the grade. Yogananda saw karma-phala-tyāga as the highest spiritual practice available to the active person: surrender the harvest to God, keep planting and tending the field. The tyāgī of this verse, he said, is the yogi in the marketplace — spiritually free, outwardly fully engaged.",
        "goyandka": "Shri Jayadayal Goyandka notes that this verse provides the definitive resolution to the chapter's opening question about sannyāsa and tyāga. As long as the prāṇas move in the body, some form of action — even the subtle actions of thought and perception — must continue. The Gita's genius is to locate renunciation not in the outer abandonment of activity but in the inner release of fruit-craving. Goyandka emphasizes that this makes the path accessible to all — the farmer, the merchant, the scholar, the warrior — each becomes a tyāgī the moment they cease working for personal gain and begin working as an instrument of the Lord."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji taught that karma is like a seed: the non-renouncer plants every action in the soil of desire, and those seeds must eventually sprout — some as thorns (aniṣṭam), some as flowers (iṣṭam), and some as thorny flowers (miśram). The inner renouncer, however, acts without sowing seeds of personal desire, so there is no harvest to return to after death. He found this verse immensely liberating for his disciples: you need not fear the fruits of right action done without ego. Do your duty, offer the result to God, and the ledger of karma is never opened against you. This is the practical mercy of tyāga.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda explains that 'pretya' — after death — is the key word here. The fruit of action does not necessarily come in this life; it accumulates as unseen karma (adṛṣṭa) to be experienced in future existences. The non-renouncer cannot escape this: pleasant actions yield pleasant births and circumstances, unpleasant ones yield suffering, and most actions yield both. The sannyāsī — the karma-phala-tyāgī of the previous verse — is exempted from all three, because their actions leave no binding residue. This is the Gita's promise of moksha through the path of action, not through withdrawal from it.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw this verse as the cosmic accounting principle: all ego-driven actions are debts that must be repaid across lifetimes. The pleasant fruit keeps you attached to samsāra, hoping for more; the unpleasant fruit generates aversion and suffering; the mixed fruit — which is most of life — keeps the wheel spinning endlessly. The only way off the wheel is to act from the center, as an instrument of the Divine will, expecting nothing. Yogananda taught that the devotee who surrenders every action and its result to God gradually burns away all karmic seeds, moving toward the ultimate freedom described here.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka emphasizes that this verse provides the strongest motivation for practicing karma-phala-tyāga: it is not merely a spiritual ideal but a direct means of freedom from the cycle of karmic return. The word 'kvacit' — never, not in any case — is absolute. The sannyāsī (inner renouncer) is completely exempted from all three fruits. Goyandka notes that this does not mean the renouncer is irresponsible or passive; rather, they are the most fully engaged actors in the world, working ceaselessly for dharma — but they work as instruments, not as proprietors, and therefore karma cannot bind them."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji saw this verse as Krishna opening one of the deepest portals of understanding for Arjuna — and for all of us. By introducing the Sāṃkhya five-factor analysis, Krishna is asking us to look beneath the surface of every action and see its complete causal structure. Dadaji taught that this knowledge is liberating: once you see how many factors conspire to produce any action, the ego's claim of sole authorship becomes laughable. 'Nibodha me' — learn from Me — is the Lord's invitation to intellectual humility. The address 'Mahābāho' (Mighty-Armed) reminds Arjuna that this wisdom is meant for the active warrior, not the recluse.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda points out that 'kṛtānte' literally means 'at the end of the established teaching' — referring to the Sāṃkhya system's final conclusions. The Gita is here borrowing from the Sāṃkhya school's analysis of causation to explain why the ego cannot be the sole doer. These five causes (enumerated in v14) are collectively responsible for every action that ever occurs. Understanding this dismantles the ahaṃkāra (ego) as the false claimant to doership and opens the student to the liberating teaching of v16-17. This is philosophical precision in the service of liberation.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda emphasized that Krishna introduces these five factors not as dry philosophical categories but as a map of liberation. When you truly understand all five components that make up any action, you naturally stop over-identifying with the ego as the doer. Yogananda saw this as a key insight for the yogi: the body, the senses, the vital forces, and the cosmic divine factor all participate in every act. The yogi who meditates deeply comes to feel this directly — 'I am not the doer' is not a theory but a living experience. This verse announces that teaching with great authority: 'Learn this from Me.'",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka notes that Sāṃkhya here refers not to the atheistic Sāṃkhya of Kapila but to the Sāṃkhya of the Gita itself — the discriminative wisdom (viveka) that distinguishes Puruṣa from Prakṛti, Self from non-Self. The five causes represent the entire apparatus of Prakṛti through which action takes place, while the Puruṣa (pure awareness) is none of these. Recognizing this distinction is the direct path to non-doership. 'Nibodha me' — Krishna says 'from Me,' the ultimate source of this wisdom — implying that this is not mere academic philosophy but revealed spiritual science."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji loved to teach these five factors as the complete anatomy of human action. The body (adhiṣṭhāna) is the field; the ego-mind (kartā) is the apparent operator; the senses (karaṇa) are the tools; the prāṇic vital forces (ceṣṭā) are the energy currents that make everything move; and daiva — the divine, the unseen grace, destiny, the Lord's will — is the silent fifth cause that underlies all the rest. Dadaji emphasized the fifth factor most: however much the ego plans and the senses reach out and the prāṇas drive the machinery, ultimately the Lord's hand turns every moment. Humility before daiva, he said, is the beginning of wisdom.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda systematically unpacks the five: 1) Adhiṣṭhāna — the physical body, the field of action and experience. 2) Kartā — the psychological ego, the 'I' that claims agency. 3) Karaṇa — the five sense organs plus the five organs of action, fourteen instruments in all. 4) Ceṣṭā — the prāṇic movements: prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna, samāna that make the body function. 5) Daiva — the unseen cosmic factor: past karma, providence, divine will, the laws of nature. Every single action requires all five. The ego's claim of sole authorship ignores four out of five causes — an absurd and bondage-producing error.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda saw in these five factors the complete map of the human instrument through which the Divine acts. The body is the temple; the ego is the gatekeeper who mistakenly thinks he owns the temple; the senses are the doors; the prāṇas are the life-force that keeps everything illumined; and daiva is the resident Deity — God Himself — who is the actual source of all movement. In deep meditation, Yogananda taught, the yogi directly perceives these layers: the body as heavy, the ego as a thought-construct, the senses as channels, the prāṇas as currents of divine energy, and finally the Divine as the ever-present ground of all experience.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka emphasizes that daiva — the fifth and final cause — is the most significant from a spiritual standpoint, because it reminds us that even after accounting for body, ego, senses, and vital forces, there remains an unseen divine factor that no human can control or predict. This includes past karma ripening in the present, the laws of dharma, divine providence, and ultimately the will of Īśvara. Goyandka points out that the truly intelligent person, understanding daiva, becomes naturally humble and surrendered. No achievement is entirely one's own, and no failure is entirely one's fault — the unseen fifth factor is always at work."

Whether Arjuna fights bravely (nyāyyam) or refuses his dharma in cowardice (viparītam), the same five causes are operative. What differs is not the mechanism but the inner orientation — the presence or absence of ego-craving, the alignment or misalignment with dharma. This understanding, Dadaji taught, should make us compassionate toward wrongdoers (they too are driven by the same machinery, conditioned by their past karma and guṇas) and humble about our own right actions (we too are products of the same five causes, graced by daiva).",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that this verse closes the five-factor analysis with a sweeping universal statement: no action — in body, speech, or mind — falls outside this causal framework. 'Nyāyyam vā viparītam vā' — right or wrong — the causes are the same. This has a critical implication for the next verse (v16): since five causes produce every action, the person who attributes all causation to the ego alone is simply wrong in fact. This is not just a spiritual failing — it is an error of perception, a misreading of reality. The five-factor analysis is thus both a cosmological truth and a diagnostic tool for dismantling egoic doership.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda emphasized the threefold scope — body, speech, mind — which covers every possible mode of human action. We commonly restrict our sense of 'action' to the physical, but the Gita includes our words and even our thoughts. Every thought, Yogananda taught, is an action with karmic consequence (mental karma); every word carries creative power (vāk karma); every physical deed leaves its mark in the world and on the soul. All three modes are governed by the same five causes. This understanding leads the yogi to purify thought and speech as rigorously as physical behavior, because all three bind or liberate equally.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka stresses the pedagogical brilliance of this verse: by explicitly including wrongful action (viparītam) alongside rightful action (nyāyyam), Krishna removes any excuse for wrong action on the grounds of 'circumstances forced me.' Even wrong actions arise from the same five causes — including daiva, past karma, and the guṇas of one's own nature. The implication is both humbling and empowering: one cannot excuse wrongdoing by blaming external factors alone, yet one can understand the deep conditioning behind it. True freedom comes from understanding this mechanism and choosing, through sattva and viveka, to align one's actions with dharma."

But when you look carefully at the five causes, where is the ego's exclusive claim? It is one factor among five, and arguably the weakest, most transient one. Dadaji called the ego's claim of sole doership a kind of spiritual dishonesty — not a moral failing but an intellectual one, rooted in avidyā. 'Akṛta-buddhi' — unformed intelligence — is the diagnosis: the intellect has not yet been sharpened by satsang, scripture, and meditation. Such a person truly does not see. They live in a projected world of their own making and call it reality.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda finds this verse a brilliant epistemological statement. The word 'paśyati' (sees) appears twice — once for the wrong seeing of the egoist and once in the negation 'na sa paśyati' (does not truly see). The egoist thinks he sees reality, but his seeing is a distortion. 'Akṛta-buddhitvāt' — because of unfinished, unrefined intelligence — this is not a permanent condition but a curable one. The prescription is the five-factor wisdom of v13-15, taken seriously. When the buddhi (intelligence) is refined by Vedantic inquiry, it naturally stops attributing all action to the ego and begins to see the vast interplay of causes. That is true seeing.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda taught that the ego's claim 'I am the doer' is the root illusion underlying all suffering. It is not sinful in a moral sense; it is simply mistaken in a cosmic sense. The ego is like a small wave on the ocean claiming: 'I produce all the water's motion.' The wave is real in its own way, but its claim of sole causation is absurd from the ocean's perspective. 'Durmatiḥ' — one of wrongly directed mind — describes the person who has invested their identity exclusively in the ego-wave. Meditation, Yogananda said, is the direct experience of the oceanic Self beneath the ego-wave — and it permanently corrects this misperception.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka notes that 'ātmānam kevalam' — the self alone — is the problem phrase. There is nothing wrong with recognizing the ego as one factor among the five; the error is the word 'kevalam' — exclusively, solely. This exclusivity is the hallmark of ahaṃkāra (ego-consciousness). Goyandka draws attention to 'akṛta-buddhitvāt' — because of unripened intelligence. The remedy is not self-condemnation but the cultivation of viveka (discriminating wisdom) through study, reflection, and surrender. When the buddhi ripens, the exclusive claim dissolves naturally, and the person comes to see action as a vast cooperative event involving the Lord's grace at every moment."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji approached this verse with great care, knowing it could be misread as permission for violence. He was clear: this is not a verse about whether to fight or not — it is a verse about the inner state that makes action either binding or liberating. The person who acts from pure duty, with no ego appropriation of doership and no attachment to results, is free even in the midst of the most extreme action. Dadaji saw this as the absolute peak of karma yoga: when the 'I' is completely surrendered, the Ātman — which never acts, never kills, never suffers — shines through. In that transparency, no karma accumulates. The warrior becomes an instrument of the Lord, and the Lord's instruments are never bound.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda calls this the most challenging verse in the Gita for the modern mind. Two qualifications are given: (1) no ego-sense of doership (na ahaṅkṛto bhāvaḥ) and (2) untainted intelligence (buddhir na lipyate — not colored by ego-desire). With both conditions met, even the act of slaying entire worlds creates no karmic bond. Why? Because karma binds through the ego's identification as doer and through the intelligence's coating of desire. Remove both, and action — however outwardly extreme — leaves no residue. Ramana Maharshi cited this verse to show that jñāna and karma are not opposed: the jñānī can act fully in the world without generating karma.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda read this verse as the Gita's most direct statement of the jīvanmukta — the one liberated while living. Such a soul acts in the world like a dream character who knows they are dreaming: fully engaged, performing every movement with precision, yet completely unbound because they know the dream is not ultimately real. 'Na hanti' — does not slay — refers to the level of the Ātman, which is never born, never slays, never dies (as taught in Ch2 v19-20). The jīvanmukta knows this through direct realization and therefore acts in the world of relative reality without being trapped by it. This is the consummation of karma yoga.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka emphasizes that this verse directly answers Arjuna's original anguish at the opening of the Gita: 'How can I slay my kinsmen?' The answer, fully revealed here, is: you are not the slayer. The Ātman does not slay. The body, the guṇas, the karmic forces, the daiva — these produce the action. When the individualized ego-self dissolves in the recognition of this truth, and the buddhi is cleared of the taint of desire, the person becomes a pure channel of dharma. Goyandka stresses that this principle — not ego, not tainted buddhi — is not the achievement of a moment but the fruit of sustained spiritual practice, and it is the highest goal the Gita holds out to every seeker."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji found this verse to be a complete philosophical miniature: the whole mystery of conscious action is captured in two triads. First, knowing — there must be a knower, something to know, and the act of knowing itself; without all three, no action arises. Second, doing — there must be an instrument, an act, and a doer; without all three, no action is complete. Dadaji pointed out that these triads are not separate from the five causes of v13-14 but complement them: the five causes explain the outer mechanics, while these triads explain the inner epistemic and agentive structure. Together they leave no room for the ego to claim sole authorship.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that this verse introduces two triadic schemes that will now be analyzed through the three guṇas in the verses that follow. The first triad — jñāna, jñeya, parijñātā — is the cognitive triad: the act of knowing, the object known, and the knowing subject. Every intentional action begins here, in awareness engaging with an object. The second triad — karaṇa, karma, kartā — is the active triad: the instruments used, the deed performed, the agent who performs it. Remarkably, the agent (kartā) appears in both the causal analysis of v14 and this active triad, which confirms that 'doership' is a structured function within Prakṛti, not the absolute truth of the Self.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda saw in these two triads the complete epistemology and phenomenology of action. The first triad mirrors the structure of consciousness itself: awareness (jñāna), its object (jñeya), and the witnessing center (parijñātā). This is exactly the structure that the meditator works to transcend: when the knower, the known, and the act of knowing merge in samādhi, ordinary motivated action ceases and divine action begins. The second triad — instrument, action, doer — is the structure of the world-drama in which the soul appears as an actor. Yogananda taught that liberation comes when both triads are seen as movements within the Divine Play (līlā), not as ultimate realities.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka emphasizes the word 'parijñātā' — the complete knower — rather than the ordinary 'jñātā.' 'Pari-' implies total, thorough, all-around knowledge. This suggests that the knower who is truly complete in knowledge eventually transcends the very subject-object split that initiates action. Goyandka sees this verse as a setup for the guṇa-analysis: before asking 'what kind of action?' Krishna asks 'what is the fundamental structure of action?' Understanding the structure is prerequisite to understanding the guṇa-coloring. The practitioner who sees the structure clearly is already beginning to detach from identification with any one component of the triads."

The three guṇas — sattva, rajas, tamas — are the dynamic qualities of Prakṛti that color everything. The same action can be sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic depending on the knowledge behind it, the manner of its execution, and the inner quality of the one doing it. Dadaji taught his students to use this guṇa-analysis as a daily mirror: 'What guṇa is driving me right now? Is this sāttvika service or rājasika ambition? Is my knowledge unifying or fragmenting?' This verse opens that mirror.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda points out that this verse announces a comprehensive three-part guṇa analysis: knowledge (v20-22), action (v23-25), and doer (v26-28) — nine verses in total. 'Yathāvat' — as they truly are — is a crucial qualifier: Krishna is not giving a rough sketch but a precise, accurate taxonomy. Guṇa-saṃkhyāne refers to the guṇa-chapter of the Sāṃkhya system. The Gita uses Sāṃkhya as a map but transcends it by adding the dimension of devotion and the Lord. Understanding guṇas is not an intellectual exercise but a practical tool for self-purification: recognize the guṇa, transcend it toward sattva, and from sattva move toward nistraiguṇya (beyond all guṇas).",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda taught that the guṇas are the three modalities of cosmic creative energy (Śakti or Prakṛti), and every human experience — every thought, feeling, action, and perception — is a mixture of these three. The sattvic is luminous, the rajasic is turbulent, the tamasic is inert. Spiritual practice is the systematic cultivation of sattva and the gradual transcendence of all three. Yogananda appreciated the Gita's precision here: by analyzing jñāna, karma, and kartā separately through the guṇa lens, Krishna gives the sincere seeker a refined diagnostic tool. 'Śṛṇu' — listen — implies deep, attentive, meditative hearing, not casual reception.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka emphasizes that 'tri-dhā eva' — exactly threefold — leaves no ambiguity: every instance of knowledge, action, and doership can be categorized as sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic. There are no exceptions, no grey areas. This precision is the strength of the Sāṃkhya method. Goyandka notes that the purpose of this classification is not to judge people as 'good' or 'bad' but to help the sincere seeker identify their predominant guṇa and work toward its elevation. He stresses 'yathāvat' — as they truly are — because self-deception is most common in the domain of guṇa-assessment: the rajasic person often believes themselves to be sattvic. Honest guṇa-discernment requires great inner clarity."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji considered this verse the crown of the jñāna section of Chapter 18. Sattvic knowledge is not mere information or even theological understanding — it is the direct vision ('īkṣate' — beholding) of the One Imperishable Being shining through the multiplicity of all creatures. Dadaji taught: when you look at a child, an elder, an animal, a tree, a stone — and in each you see the same light, the same Ātman, the same Brahman — that is sattvic jñāna. This is not a poetic metaphor but an actual perceptual transformation that comes through purification of the antaḥkaraṇa (inner instrument). 'Avibhaktaṃ vibhakteṣu' — the Undivided in the divided — he called the most compact expression of Advaita Vedānta.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda identifies this as a restatement of the central Vedantic insight: Brahman/Ātman is one, non-dual, undivided, even though it appears as the multiplicity of the world's forms. 'Avibhaktaṃ vibhakteṣu' is a perfect paradox that is the experience of the Advaitic seer: the many forms are real appearances, but the One Being is the real substance. This is sattvic knowledge because sattva is the guṇa of clarity, transparency, and truth. Only in a sattvic mind — purified of ego, desire, and confusion — can this non-dual vision arise spontaneously. Rajasic and tamasic minds see only the divisions, the fragments, the 'me and not-me.'",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda taught that this verse describes the cosmic consciousness — the direct perception of God as the One Self inhabiting all forms simultaneously. In the superconscious state of samādhi, the boundaries between self and other, between perceiver and perceived, dissolve. What remains is the Imperishable (avyayam) — the unchanging ocean of divine Being — experienced as equally present in every wave of individual existence. Yogananda said this perception permanently transforms the seer: they can no longer hate, fear, or despise any being, because in every being they see the same Beloved. This is the jñāna that leads directly to the highest bhakti.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka notes that 'īkṣate' — beholding — is a strong perceptual term, not just an intellectual acknowledgment. The sattvic knower does not merely believe in theoretical non-duality; they actually perceive the undivided Being in all divided forms. Goyandka connects this to the earlier teaching in Ch13 v27 ('samaṃ paśyan hi sarvatra') — seeing the same everywhere. He emphasizes that this sattvic knowledge is not the conclusion of guṇa-evolution but its highest point before transcendence: sattva illumines the non-dual truth, and that illumination itself becomes the springboard for nistraiguṇya — going beyond all three guṇas into the purity of the Ātman itself."
