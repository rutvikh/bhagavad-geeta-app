      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "Beloved, the Lord here reveals a tender and important truth: effort alone is not enough — the heart must also be purified. The yogin who has lovingly worked on himself, surrendering ego and desire, finds the Ātman shining within like a lamp in a clean room. But one who strives with an impure mind is like a person searching for the sun with eyes full of dust. Dear seeker, let your sādhana be not only vigorous but also cleansing — so that when you look within, the Lord's own light greets you.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "From the Advaita standpoint, the Ātman is ever self-luminous and self-evident — it is not something to be attained but recognized. The distinction here is subtle: both the yogin and the akṛtātmān strive, yet only one sees. The difference is antaḥkaraṇa-śuddhi — purity of the inner instrument. The mind purified through ethical discipline, dispassion, and meditation becomes transparent, and the Ātman, which was always present as pure Awareness, is recognized directly. The unpurified mind superimposes objects and agitations, obscuring the very Awareness it seeks.",
        "yogananda": "The inner eye of intuition — the spiritual eye of which Christ spoke — opens only when the turbulence of ego, desire, and restlessness has been stilled through sustained yoga practice. The yogin referenced here is not merely a physical practitioner but one who has interiorized all faculties and directed them Godward. The akṛtātmān, despite external effort, has not yet turned the searchlight of attention away from the senses and inward to the spine and brain, where God's presence is directly felt. Purification of the nervous system and the subtle body through Kriyā-like techniques is the indispensable preparation.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Śaṅkarācārya glosses 'akṛtātmānaḥ' as those who have not cultivated the inner self through the practices of śama (mental restraint), dama (sense restraint), and the other sādhana-catuṣṭaya. Mere intellectual striving or external ritual cannot substitute for this inner work. 'Acetasaḥ' points to the absence of a refined cetanā — a consciousness sharpened by viveka and vairāgya. The scriptural injunction thus is clear: before embarking on the inquiry into the Self, one must prepare the ground through the prescribed spiritual disciplines as outlined in Vedāntic tradition."

        "dadaji": "How lovingly the Lord here points to Himself in the grandest and most familiar of cosmic phenomena! When you see the morning sun bathe the world in golden light, know that it is the Lord's own glory streaming forth. When the gentle moon soothes the night with silver coolness, that nourishing grace is His. The fire that warms and transforms — again, His tejas. The devotee who meditates on this verse begins to see the Lord's face everywhere, in every beam of light and every flicker of flame. This is the beginning of cosmic vision.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse initiates the Lord's vibhūti-yoga within Chapter 15, tracing all cosmic luminosity back to its ultimate source in Brahman. The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad declares: 'Na tatra sūryo bhāti na candra-tārakam' — the sun does not shine there, nor the moon, nor the stars; by the light of Brahman alone do all these shine. The Lord here echoes that śruti: the tejas of the sun, moon, and fire is not independent but derivative. Brahman alone is self-luminous (svayaṃprakāśa); everything else is luminous only by borrowing that primordial light.",
        "yogananda": "Science tells us that all energy in the solar system flows from the sun — but what is the source of the sun's energy? The Lord here reveals the metaphysical truth: the cosmic energy behind all light is divine. In meditation, when prana is withdrawn from the senses and focused at the spiritual eye, the meditator perceives an inner light far more luminous than sunlight — the inner sun of the Ātman. This is not metaphor; it is direct experience. The visible light of sun, moon, and fire are outer reflections of that inner divine luminosity which the Lord here claims as His own.",
        "goyandka": "The Kaṭha Upaniṣad (2.2.15) is the scriptural backdrop: 'Tameva bhāntam anubhāti sarvaṃ, tasya bhāsā sarvam idaṃ vibhāti' — by His light alone does everything shine; by His luminosity all this is illumined. The Lord here makes explicit in the Gītā what the Upaniṣads state more abstractly. 'Viddhi māmakam' — the imperative to know is instructive: this is not a fact to be accepted intellectually but a truth to be continuously contemplated as part of one's jñāna-abhyāsa. The meditator on this verse gradually dissolves the illusion that light belongs to objects and recognizes the one luminous Ātman."

        "dadaji": "The Lord is not a distant deity sitting in the heavens — He is the very ground beneath our feet, the nourishing moisture in every plant, the vital sap in every living cell. 'Gām āviśya' — He has entered the earth and sustains all life through His own ojas, His radiant life-force. And as the gentle Moon, He fills every herb and plant with rasa — the sweet juice of life. When you eat food, beloved, know that the Lord Himself has lovingly nourished it for you. This vision transforms every meal into prasāda.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad identifies the cosmic Person (Puruṣa) as the inner essence of all elements. Here the Lord specifies two of His cosmic functions: as the principle of gravitational cohesion within the earth (ojas — vital binding force) that holds all beings together, and as Soma — the lunar principle governing moisture, growth, and the rasa (essence) of all plant life. In Vedic cosmology, the moon is the source of the vegetative principle. The Vedāntic insight is that behind both the gross physical moon and the subtle principle of rasa stands the one Brahman — here declaring 'I am that.'",
        "yogananda": "The human body is largely water, and every cell depends on the lunar cycles, the tides of prāṇa, and the nourishing life-force the Vedic seers called soma. When we eat a fruit or a grain, we are consuming stored sunlight and moonlight — stored divine energy. In deep meditation, the yogi perceives this life-force (prāṇa) as a luminous current sustaining the body from within. The Lord here reveals that the very same cosmic intelligence that directs the growth of a blade of grass also sustains the cells of the meditator's body. All nourishment, at its deepest level, is divine grace.",
        "goyandka": "Commentators note that this verse reveals the Lord's saguṇa aspect as the cosmic sustainer (dhātā). 'Ojas' in the Āyurvedic tradition is the subtlest essence of the seven dhātus — the vital vitality that holds the body and its functions in coherence. That the Lord enters the earth (prithvī-tattva) and supports beings through this subtlest energy is a teaching about the Antaryāmin being the true sustainer behind all physical processes. Similarly, the moon's role in nourishing vegetation through its gravitational and subtle influences is here credited to the Lord's own presence as Soma."

        "dadaji": "How intimate is the Lord's presence! He is not only in the vast cosmos but inside your own stomach, lovingly digesting the food you eat to sustain this body He has given you. Vaiśvānara — the universal fire within all creatures — is the Lord Himself. Next time you eat, dear one, feel that the Lord inside you is accepting the offering of food. The Gītā in Chapter 4 calls this a yajña — the offering of food into the fire of Brahman. Now you see why: the fire receiving the offering is the Lord Himself.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The Chāndogya Upaniṣad (5.18.1) identifies Vaiśvānara as the cosmic Self in the context of the pañcāgni-vidyā (doctrine of five fires). Here the same teaching is made personal: every digestive fire in every creature is the Lord's own presence. The Vedāntic significance is that the innermost life-processes — breathing, digesting, the coordination of prāṇa and apāna — are not mechanical but are the Lord's own activity. There is no level of existence, not even biological, where the divine is absent. This is the Advaitic vision of the Lord as the material and efficient cause of all.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda taught that prāṇa — the life-force — is the mediator between consciousness and matter. The interplay of prāṇa and apāna described here corresponds to the subtle energy currents that yogis learn to control through prāṇāyāma. When a yogi masters these currents, he becomes aware of the divine fire burning within — not as metaphor but as direct experience of the Vaiśvānara. The four kinds of food are sustained by this fire, but the ultimate nourishment, Yogananda taught, is prāṇic — the yogi who can draw energy from divine sources requires less material food.",
        "goyandka": "The four varieties of food (catur-vidha anna) are enumerated in the traditional commentaries as: bhojya (chewed, as grains), bhakṣya (that which is bitten off in pieces), lehya (that which is licked), and peyya (that which is drunk). These cover the full range of nutrition the body requires. The Vaiśvānara fire, energized by the twin prāṇic forces of inhalation and exhalation, transforms all of these into life-sustaining nourishment. This verse firmly establishes the Lord as the direct sustaining principle within biological life — beyond being merely a distant creator."

From Him comes the memory that connects our past to our present, the jñāna that reveals the ultimate truth, and even the merciful apohana — the divine grace of forgetting what is no longer needed for our growth. And then He says with great tenderness: 'I am what all the Vedas seek to reveal.' The entire scripture, all eighteen thousand verses of the Vedas, all the Upaniṣads — all are pointing their finger toward this One who sits in your own heart. Dear devotee, you need go no further than within.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This is perhaps the most philosophically rich verse of the chapter. 'Hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ' — the Antaryāmin of the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, 'He who dwells within the heart, yet the heart does not know.' The three gifts — smṛti, jñāna, apohana — are interpreted by Śaṅkara as: the memory that enables functional cognition, the liberating knowledge that dispels ignorance, and the removal of both (transcendence of the mind-knowledge complex in samādhi). 'Vedānta-kṛt' — the Lord as the source of the Upaniṣadic teaching confirms Advaita's position that śruti is an impersonal revelation of the nature of Brahman.",
        "yogananda": "In this verse, the Lord reveals the mechanics of inner spiritual development: memory, insight, and ultimately transcendence all flow from the same divine source seated within. The great saints across traditions have reported this same experience — a sense of inner guidance, of knowledge arising from a source deeper than the intellect. Yogananda described the Antaryāmin as accessible through deep meditation at the heart center, where — when the devotee is sufficiently still — the Lord communicates directly as intuition. The 'removal' (apohana) is the final grace: the dissolution of even the meditator's mind into God-consciousness.",
        "goyandka": "The compound 'vedānta-kṛt' bears two important interpretations in the commentarial tradition. Śaṅkarācārya takes it as the author of the Vedānta (Upaniṣads), reinforcing that the Lord is the source of all śruti. Madhvācārya and others take it as the establisher of the Brahma-sūtras. Both interpretations converge on a single point: the Lord is not merely a figure described in scripture but the very source from which scripture arises. He is simultaneously the subject of all Vedic knowledge (vedya), its author (vedānta-kṛt), and its knower (veda-vit) — a perfect, self-referential circle of divine self-disclosure."

The beloved Lord is preparing us for the great revelation of the next verse: that He Himself is beyond even this unchanging ground. But first, He asks us to contemplate these two — to see the world as kṣara and to seek the akṣara within our own depths.",

The Kṣara corresponds to the vyākṛta — the manifested, name-and-form world — including all individual jīvas bound in saṃsāra. The Akṣara is the avyākṛta, the Unmanifest — the primordial Prakṛti of Sāṃkhya or the Māyā-śakti of Advaita, which persists as the unchanging substratum through all cycles of creation and dissolution. The word 'kūṭa-sthaḥ' — literally 'standing like a mountain peak' or 'like an anvil' — implies absolute immovability. This distinction is critical: even the 'unchanging' ground of phenomenal existence is still a lower order of reality than the Uttama Puruṣa revealed in v17.",
        "yogananda": "In the language of yogic cosmology, the Kṣara represents the entire field of māyā — the vibratory creation with all its beings caught in the cycle of birth and death. The Akṣara represents the cosmic causal body — the primordial matrix of unmanifested consciousness from which the universe periodically emerges. Even in the individual, there is the changing personality (kṣara) and the deeper, relatively unchanging causal body (akṣara). But the Lord here prepares us for a higher truth: He transcends both. True liberation lies not in reaching the causal plane but in realizing the Puruṣottama beyond it.",
        "goyandka": "Classical Vedāntic commentaries identify the Kṣara with the jīva-rāśi — the collective of all individual souls bound to prakṛti through the five sheaths (pañcakośas). The Akṣara is identified with avyakta — the primordial, unmanifested state of prakṛti which, though not empirically active, persists as the ground of manifestation. Some commentators following Rāmānuja identify Akṣara with the liberated souls (mukta-jīvas) in Vaikuṇṭha, who are eternal and unchanging in their blessed state. All schools agree that both are transcended by the Uttama Puruṣa of the following verse."

While Sāṃkhya recognized two principles (Puruṣa and Prakṛti) and earlier Vedānta sometimes collapsed into a pure non-dualism, the Gītā here presents a hierarchy: the relative individual (Kṣara), the absolute ground (Akṣara), and the Supreme Person who transcends both while containing both. Śaṅkara interprets this as: Kṣara = jīvas, Akṣara = Māyā, Uttama Puruṣa = Nirguṇa Brahman. Rāmānuja interprets: Kṣara = bound souls, Akṣara = liberated souls, Uttama = Nārāyaṇa. Both readings honor the supremacy of v17.",
        "yogananda": "This is the divine summit of Chapter 15. The Paramātman — the Cosmic Intelligence that animates and sustains every atom in the three planes of existence — is here identified as the Uttama Puruṣa. In yogic experience, after passing through the states of ordinary waking consciousness (Kṣara) and deep causal stillness (Akṣara), there is a state of cosmic consciousness in which the meditator perceives the divine Awareness that permeates and sustains all. This is not a philosophical abstraction — it is the direct experience of Paramātman that great saints have reported through the ages. The Lord is telling Arjuna: 'That which the greatest yogis attain — that is I.'",
        "goyandka": "The word 'tu' (but/however) in this verse is grammatically significant — it marks a decisive contrast with what preceded. The Uttama Puruṣa is not merely the greatest of the two or the synthesis of both — He is categorically 'anyaḥ,' different, transcendent. 'Loka-trayam āviśya bibharti' — entering and sustaining the three worlds — echoes the Puruṣa-sūkta of the Ṛg Veda, where the cosmic Puruṣa pervades all of creation. 'Avyaya Īśvaraḥ' — inexhaustible Sovereign — establishes His absolute sovereignty and infinite plenitude: His sustaining activity never depletes His own nature."

He does not boast — He explains, with loving logic: 'Because I am beyond the perishable, and higher than even the imperishable — therefore, dear one, the sages of the Vedas and the beloved people of this world call Me Puruṣottama.' This is not arrogance but gracious self-revelation so that the devotee may know fully Whom he worships. When we chant 'Puruṣottama,' we are acknowledging this reality: our Beloved is not limited by any category, not even the loftiest — He is uttama, the very best, beyond all comparison.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is the logical conclusion of the chapter's metaphysical arc. The title 'Puruṣottama' appears rarely in the Upaniṣads but becomes a central theological term in the Gītā. Its meaning here is precise: not 'the best Puruṣa among many' but 'the one who transcends the very category of Puruṣa as defined by the Kṣara/Akṣara division.' He is uttama — highest — not in a relative sense but absolutely, standing outside any comparative framework. 'Loke vede ca prathitaḥ' — celebrated in both the world (popular tradition) and the Vedas (scriptural tradition) — grounds the title in both lived devotion and śāstric authority.",
        "yogananda": "The name Puruṣottama carries an extraordinary vibrational power. Yogananda taught that the names of God, when chanted with understanding and devotion, carry the actual divine presence. Here the Lord reveals the meaning behind the name He bears in the eternal tradition — a name that synthesizes the entire metaphysical framework of the chapter. To know that the Lord one worships transcends both the relative world and the absolute ground is to worship with full philosophical clarity and unreserved devotion. Partial understanding leads to partial surrender; complete understanding — knowing Him as Puruṣottama — enables total surrender.",
        "goyandka": "The word 'prathitaḥ' — celebrated, well known — is important. The Lord does not say 'I declare Myself' but 'I am known / celebrated.' This is an appeal to the universal recognition of this truth in both Vedic literature and in the hearts of the wise across ages. The Nārāyaṇīya section of the Mahābhārata, the Viṣṇu Sahasranāma, and the Upaniṣads all use derivatives of this title. Puruṣottama is thus not a private claim but a universally recognized revelation — the convergence of scriptural testimony and the direct experience of seers about the nature of the Supreme."

        "dadaji": "The Lord here pronounces the most beautiful fruit of this chapter's wisdom: he who knows Puruṣottama becomes sarva-vid — all-knowing. Not because he has memorized all facts, but because knowing the Source of all, he knows all that truly matters. And what happens to such a one? He worships with sarva-bhāvena — with his whole being, every breath, every thought, every action becoming an act of worship. This is the natural flowering of true jñāna into perfect bhakti. Knowledge of the Supreme does not lead to cold detachment — it leads to wholehearted, joyful, complete surrender in love.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The correlation drawn here between jñāna and bhakti is philosophically significant and points toward Vedānta's integral vision. 'Asammūḍhaḥ' — undeluded — is the prerequisite: clear discrimination (viveka) about the true nature of the Lord as Puruṣottama. 'Sarva-vid' — knowing the Absolute, one knows the ground of all, and thus knows 'all' in the most essential sense. Then — not instead of devotion but as its fullest expression — 'sarva-bhāvena bhajati': worships with every state of being. The Narada Bhakti Sūtras describe this as 'sarvārpaṇa' — total offering. The jñāni and the bhakta meet here in the highest state.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda often said that the goal of all spiritual practice is to 'know God and know yourself' — and here the Lord confirms that knowing Him as Puruṣottama is the culmination of all knowing. 'Sarva-bhāvena' — Yogananda translated this as 'in all the ways of loving': with the devotion of a child, a friend, a servant, a beloved. When the intellectual recognition of the Puruṣottama is fully integrated, it spontaneously ignites all-encompassing love. The mind no longer seeks anything outside God; every moment becomes worship. This is the state of paramabhakti — the supreme devotion the Gītā has been building toward throughout.",
        "goyandka": "The use of 'evam' (thus — in the manner declared in verses 16-18) is crucial: this is not generic knowledge of a Supreme Being but specific, articulate understanding of the three-Puruṣa framework and the Lord's unique status as Puruṣottama. This precision of understanding (viveka-jñāna) is what qualifies one as 'asammūḍha' — free from the delusion that confuses the Lord with the Kṣara world or even with the Akṣara ground. Upon this foundation of clear jñāna, the bhakti that arises is not sentimental but firmly rooted — sarva-bhāvena, comprehensive, unwavering, and utterly complete."

The Lord does not say 'this verse' or 'this topic' but 'this śāstram' — this complete teaching forms, in itself, a scripture of the highest order. Śaṅkara notes that its secrecy lies not in concealment but in its subtlety: this teaching about the three Puruṣas and the supremacy of the Puruṣottama cannot be grasped by the uninitiated. 'Kṛta-kṛtyaḥ' — this compound is the Vedic formula for complete fulfillment: all ṛṇas (debts) paid, all goals achieved, all duties discharged. The knower of Puruṣottama has transcended the entire framework of duty and debt.",
        "yogananda": "Every great scripture closes with a benediction, and here the Lord's closing words carry enormous power: 'know this and be free.' The chapter began with the cosmic tree of saṃsāra — inverted, hard to see, rooted in Brahman — and ends here with the direct revelation of Brahman as Puruṣottama seated in every heart. The journey from the entangled cosmic tree to the free recognition of the Supreme Person in one's own heart — that is Chapter 15. 'Buddhimān syāt' — one becomes truly intelligent. Worldly intelligence accumulates facts; divine intelligence knows the one Fact from which all others derive their meaning.",
        "goyandka": "The closing of Chapter 15 with the declaration 'guhyatamaṃ śāstram' reflects the Vedic tradition of self-referential statements within sacred texts. The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad similarly concludes by calling itself the means to the highest liberation. Here the Lord asserts the unique status of this fifteen-chapter teaching as a self-contained revelatory scripture on the Supreme — more esoteric than the karma-yoga of early chapters, more direct than the bhakti-yoga passages. 'Kṛta-kṛtyaḥ ca bhārata' — the final words — echo the Taittirīya Upaniṣad's declaration of the knower of Brahman: 'He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman.' All seeking ceases in the fullness of this knowing."
