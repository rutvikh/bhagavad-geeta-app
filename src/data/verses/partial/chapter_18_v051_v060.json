        "dadaji": "This verse begins a three-verse sequence — a portrait of the fully prepared seeker. The first quality is viśuddha buddhi, purified intelligence. Until the intellect is cleansed of its distortions — its likes, its prejudices, its subtle attachments — it cannot reflect the Self clearly. 'Dhṛtyā ātmānaṃ niyamya' means controlling oneself not through harsh suppression but through the quiet power of inner steadiness. Śabdādīn viṣayān tyaktvā — beginning with sound. Why sound? Because it reaches us even with eyes closed — it is the most subtle and pervasive of the sense-objects. Rāga and dveṣa, attraction and aversion, are the twin movements of the ego that keep the wheel of bondage turning. To 'vyudasya' them — to cast them fully aside — is the great freedom.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Vivekananda used to say: the first step is always purification. Here Kṛṣṇa gives us the exact anatomy of purification. Buddhi must become viśuddha — this happens through sustained practice of viveka (discrimination), the persistent asking 'what is real?' Dhṛti is often translated as courage, but here it means the resilient, steady fortitude that holds the mind in place even when old habits pull it outward. Viṣayāṃs tyaktvā does not demand physical withdrawal from all sense-experience, but the inner withdrawal of dependence — the recognition that no external object carries genuine fulfillment. The casting aside of rāga-dveṣa is the hallmark of the steady sage described in Chapter Two. Without releasing these twin forces, no practice, however elaborate, can bear ultimate fruit.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda taught that purification of the intellect (viśuddha buddhi) is precisely what the science of Kriyā Yoga accomplishes: the prāṇic cleansing that gradually refines the cerebrospinal centers until the light of pure awareness can shine without distortion. Dhṛti, steadfastness, is the quality of the devotee who does not waver despite the pull of old habits and sense-memories. 'Śabdādīn viṣayān tyaktvā' — sound is listed first because the AUM vibration, the divine sound, replaces the scattered sounds of the world in deep meditation. When the yogi interiorizes sound, all other sense-pulls naturally subside. Rāga and dveṣa are the locks on the prison of ego; their removal by sustained inner practice is what the entire Gita has been pointing toward.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Jayadayal Goyandka notes that this verse begins the description of the qualified aspirant who is ready to attain Brahman, following naturally from verse 50 where naiṣkarmya-siddhi was described. 'Viśuddhayā buddhyā' means the intellect that has been purified through the practices described throughout the Gita — study, service, devotion, discrimination. 'Dhṛtyā ātmānaṃ niyamya' indicates self-mastery maintained not by external force but by the inner fire of discrimination. The abandonment of viṣayas beginning with śabda means the seeker is no longer driven by sense-contact. And the removal of rāga-dveṣa — the root cause of all karmic bondage as Kṛṣṇa explained in Chapter 3 — signals that the soil of the mind is ready for the seed of Brahman-knowledge."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "Vivikta-sevī — the lover of solitude. Not a misanthrope, not one who flees from duty, but one who has cultivated the taste for inner silence. Solitude is not a place; it is a quality of inner life. The great teachers sought external solitude precisely because they had cultivated inner solitude and wanted the two to reinforce each other. Laghv-āśī — light eating. This is not mere asceticism. A heavy stomach weighs down the mind; simplicity in food supports simplicity in consciousness. Yata-vāk-kāya-mānasaḥ — the triple control: speech, body, mind. These three are not separate; they reinforce each other. A controlled tongue supports a controlled mind, and vice versa. And then 'dhyāna-yoga-paraḥ nityam' — always having meditation as the highest. This is the mark of the true sādhaka: meditation is not an exercise but the center of life.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "These qualities form a practical curriculum. Vivikta-sevī: Ramakrishna would go alone to the Panchavati grove; Swami Vivekananda would take long solitary walks — the great ones knew that solitude, even brief and regular, is the indispensable nutrient of spiritual life. Laghv-āśī connects to the teaching in Chapter 17 on sāttvika āhāra — food that promotes clarity. Excessive eating dulls the prāṇas and the mind. 'Yata-vāk' — controlled speech — is particularly notable: more energy is dissipated through unnecessary speech than almost any other channel. The discipline of silence, even partial, is transformative. Dhyāna-yoga-paro nityam: meditation is not a daily chore but the gravitational center around which all life orbits. Vairāgyam samupāśritaḥ — fully sheltering in dispassion, not merely practicing it occasionally but making it one's very home.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansaji was fond of saying that the yogi must guard his energy. Vivikta-sevī — solitude — protects one's prāṇic field from constant dissipation through social stimulation. The ashram, the meditation room, the garden in early morning — these are the 'vivikta' spaces that conserve and deepen spiritual force. Laghv-āśī reflects the Yogic principle: the fire of digestion competes with the fire of meditation; when food is kept simple and light, prāṇa rises rather than sinking to serve digestive work. Yata-vāk-kāya-mānasaḥ — the threefold control — corresponds beautifully to the three bodies: the gross (kāya), subtle (vāk as prāṇic expression), and causal (mānasa). And 'dhyāna-yoga-paro nityam' — always supremely devoted to meditation — is the direct description of a Kriyā Yogi whose entire life is structured around the deepening of meditative union.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji observes that this verse continues the portrait seamlessly from verse 51 — the three verses together form an integrated description, not a checklist of separate items. Vivikta-sevī: external solitude supports internal withdrawal of the senses (pratyāhāra). The Gita does not demand forest-dwelling, but it does honor the seeker who creates protected spaces for the inner life. Laghv-āśī is prescribed across all scripture — the Yoga-sūtras speak of mitāhāra (moderate eating) as a niyama for the same reason. Yata-vāk: the Upaniṣads repeatedly prescribe mauna (silence) as a support to knowledge, because truth is known in silence, not in speech. Dhyāna-yoga-paraḥ nityam: the word 'nityam' is key — not occasional meditation but a life entirely permeated by the meditative spirit. Vairāgyam samupāśritaḥ: the prefix 'sam' in samupāśritaḥ indicates completeness — not partial dispassion but a total, wholehearted taking of refuge in non-attachment."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "This verse closes the three-verse portrait with the most demanding list: ahaṃkāra, bala, darpa, kāma, krodha, parigraha — six inner obstacles to be 'vimucya,' completely released. Ahaṃkāra is the root: the false I, the sense of being a separate, independent agent. Bala here does not mean strength itself but strength wielded with pride — the subtle spiritual ego that says 'I am a great sādhaka, I have great tapas.' Darpa is vanity, the inflation of self. Kāma and krodha — desire and anger — were identified in Chapter 3 as the enemy born of rajo-guṇa. Parigraha, possessiveness, is the grasping that accumulates. 'Nirmamaḥ śāntaḥ' — free from 'mine' and at peace. These two go together: as long as we claim things as 'mine,' the mind is never at peace. When the claiming ceases, peace is natural. 'Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate' — becomes fit for the Brahman-state. This is not an achievement but a recognition: Brahman is what we already are, and these qualities allow that truth to be seen.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Shankara comments extensively on 'brahma-bhūyāya kalpate' — it means one becomes fit, becomes ready. The Brahman-state is not earned; it is uncovered. These six — ahaṃkāra, bala, darpa, kāma, krodha, parigraha — are the coverings. Note that 'bala' (force or strength) appears between ahaṃkāra and darpa: pride in one's strength is particularly sticky for the spiritual ego. The practitioner who has gained some power through practice must be especially vigilant about this. 'Nirmama' — the complete dissolution of the 'mine' sense — is the hallmark of genuine non-attachment. Ramakrishna would say: the disease is 'I and mine.' Remove 'mine' first, then 'I' dissolves on its own. Śānta — peaceful. This peace is not emotional tranquility but the peace that the Upaniṣads describe as the very nature of Brahman: śāntam, śivam, advaitam.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansaji taught that the ego (ahaṃkāra) is the central obstruction — it is the crystallized habit of identifying the infinite Self with the finite body-mind complex. Bala used egoically is the pride of the body and its powers; in the spiritual path this becomes the pride of one's spiritual achievements, which is perhaps the subtlest and most dangerous form. Kāma and krodha — desire and anger — are the disturbers of prāṇa: desire scatters it outward; anger burns it wastefully. Parigraha — grasping — keeps the practitioner bound to the material plane even when spiritual practice is engaged. 'Nirmamaḥ śāntaḥ': when the devotee fully offers all to God — 'nothing is mine, all is Thine' — the 'mine' sense melts and deep peace floods the being. 'Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate' — then the soul is ripe, as the fruit is ripe: it falls naturally into the realization of its own infinite nature.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji notes that these six — ahaṃkāra, bala, darpa, kāma, krodha, parigraha — represent the full range of the ego's expressions: its identity (ahaṃkāra), its power (bala), its inflation (darpa), its hunger (kāma), its heat (krodha), and its accumulation (parigraha). To release all six through 'vimucya' — the gerund indicating prior completion — means the seeker has already accomplished these renunciations before arriving at the Brahman-state. 'Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate': Kalpate means 'becomes suited' or 'becomes fit.' The Ācārya explains this as: the person with these qualities does not have to search for Brahman — they naturally are established in Brahman, because these qualities constitute the very definition of Brahman-realization. The jīva does not become Brahman (which would be impossible if Brahman is already all); rather, the appearance of limitation dissolves and the eternally-existing Brahman-nature stands revealed."

'Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā' — having become Brahman, the inner Self is prasanna: serene, transparent, luminous, like still water that reflects the sky perfectly. And then three marks of this state: no grief (na śocati), no desire (na kāṅkṣati), equal vision to all beings (samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu). Grief is the response to loss; desire is the reaching for what is not yet held. When one has realized oneself as Brahman — the fullness itself — what could be lost? What could be lacking? And equal vision: not indifference, but the profound recognition that the same Ātman shines in all. Then the most startling line: from this Brahman-realization one attains 'mad-bhaktiṃ parām' — supreme devotion to the Lord. Jñāna does not end in cold transcendence; it flowers into the highest bhakti. This is the synthesis of the Gita.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Vivekananda said that the Jñāni and the Bhakta arrive at the same summit by different paths. This verse is the Gita's declaration of that truth. The Brahman-realized soul — brahma-bhūtaḥ — does not become a stone; it attains mad-bhaktiṃ parām, supreme devotion. How? Because in the state of universal equality (samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu), the apparent separation between devotee and God dissolves, and what remains is the pure relationship of love beyond duality. 'Prasannātmā' deserves attention: prasanna means not just peaceful but luminous, transparent — like a cloudless sky. The three marks (no grief, no desire, equal vision) map precisely onto the description of the sthita-prajña in Chapter 2. Kṛṣṇa is drawing the entire Gita together: the teaching begun in Chapter 2 is now fulfilled in Chapter 18.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansaji called this verse one of the great synthesis-statements of the Gita. 'Brahma-bhūtaḥ' — the soul that has merged into the cosmic consciousness — is 'prasannātmā': its innermost being is like a still, clear lake. In this state, grief (śoka) has no basis — because grief arises from loss of the finite, and this soul has found the Infinite. Desire (kāṅkṣā) has no foothold — because desire is the sense of incompleteness, and this soul rests in the Fullness. 'Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu' — this is the vision of the illumined sage who sees the same Divine Light in the saint and the sinner, the elephant and the ant, the particle and the galaxy. And then 'mad-bhaktiṃ labhate parām': from this universal sameness, the purest, most exalted form of devotion — not the devotion of the beginner who sees God as separate, but the devotion of the knower who loves because love is the very nature of the realized Self.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji observes the crucial transition in this verse: verse 53 ended with 'brahma-bhūyāya kalpate' (becomes fit for Brahman); verse 54 opens with 'brahma-bhūtaḥ' (having become Brahman). The condition becomes the reality. The three characteristics — na śocati, na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu — are the practical, observable signs of this realization. A teacher can recognize the brahma-bhūta state precisely by these qualities. Then 'mad-bhaktiṃ labhate parām': the Viśiṣṭādvaita tradition (Rāmānuja) reads this verse as its central proof-text — that the highest state is not featureless Brahman but the loving relationship with the personal Lord. Even from a non-dual standpoint, this verse shows that realization of the Absolute naturally expresses itself as the purest love, because the nature of Brahman is ānanda — bliss — and bliss in relation is love."

It is not mere intellectual information about God but the direct knowing of the heart. 'Yāvān yaś cāsmi' — both the quantitative (yāvān: how immense) and qualitative (yaḥ: who/what) aspects of the Divine are known. This double knowing — breadth and depth — is given only through bhakti. 'Tato māṃ tattvato jñātvā viśate tad-anantaram': the sequence is tight and beautiful — know truly, then enter immediately.

The intellect, however sharp, deals in concepts; but love reaches the reality directly, the way a child knows its mother — not by her description but by her presence. 'Yāvān yaś cāsmi' — who and how great the Lord is. In deep meditative devotion — bhāva samādhi — the yogi directly perceives the grandeur (yāvān) and intimate presence (yaḥ) of the Divine simultaneously. 'Viśate tad-anantaram' — enters immediately. This is the promise of Kriyā Yoga: through the intensification of divine love powered by prāṇāyāma practice, the devotee does not have to wait for death to 'enter' the Lord. The entry is available NOW, in this body, in this lifetime.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji notes that 'bhaktyā' here has a very specific meaning: not the bhakti of the beginner who loves an external God, but the parā bhakti spoken of in the previous verse (mad-bhaktiṃ parām). This supreme bhakti, born from Brahman-realization, is the instrument of the final knowing. 'Tattvataḥ abhijānāti' — knows in essence. The tattva of the Lord is not accessible to the ego-bound intellect; it is accessible only to the purified heart that has dissolved its separateness through bhakti. 'Tato māṃ tattvato jñātvā viśate tad-anantaram': the word 'tad-anantaram' means 'immediately thereafter, without interval.' There is no gap between true knowing and entry. This is the highest promise of the Gita: true devotional knowledge of God is simultaneously union with God. The path and the arrival are, at the deepest level, the same moment."

        "dadaji": "The word 'api' in 'sarva-karmāṇy api' carries enormous weight. 'Even all actions' — no action needs to be stopped, no duty abandoned, no worldly responsibility discarded. The entire range of life's activity can continue. What changes is the inner orientation: 'mad-vyapāśrayaḥ' — taking complete, full refuge in Me. This is not partial surrender or occasional prayer; it is the total re-centering of one's being in God. And then: 'mat-prasādāt avāpnoti' — attains by My grace. The destination — the eternal, imperishable state — is reached not by human effort alone but by divine grace. This is the teaching of the Gita's deepest strand: when surrender is complete, grace becomes operative. The ego that was trying to reach God by its own power steps aside, and God's own nature — which is always reaching toward the devotee — takes over.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is one of the great declarations of karma-yoga: full engagement in action combined with full surrender to the Lord is not only spiritually valid but spiritually supreme. Ramakrishna's householder disciples — like Balaram Bose, Girish Ghosh — exemplified this: lives full of worldly activity, yet centered entirely in God. 'Sadā kurvāṇaḥ' — always performing. 'Sarva-karmāṇi' — all actions. 'Api' — even. Not just some idealized actions but the whole messy, complex life of duties. 'Mat-prasādāt' — by My grace. Śaṅkara comments that 'prasāda' here means the direct illumination of the Lord that removes the ignorance which was the only obstacle. Śāśvatam padam avyayam — the eternal, inexhaustible state. This is Brahman, Mokṣa, the fourth (turīya) — named here by its two greatest qualities: permanence (śāśvatam) and imperishability (avyayam).",
        "yogananda": "This verse was central to Paramahansaji's teaching about how to live in the world as a yogi. He called it the 'householder's liberation verse.' 'Sarva-karmāṇy api sadā kurvāṇaḥ' — one who is always engaged in all duties. 'Mad-vyapāśrayaḥ' — who has taken complete refuge in the Infinite. This is the person who has learned to 'offer every breath to God,' to make every act a worship, every duty a sacrament. The key word is 'vyapāśraya' — complete, thorough refuge, not partial or occasional. 'Mat-prasādāt avāpnoti' — divine grace does the final work. The yogi's practice opens the channel; grace flows through. 'Śāśvatam padam avyayam' — the state that is eternal and inexhaustible. In Kriyā Yoga terms: the realization of the soul's identity with the ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new Bliss.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji emphasizes the phrase 'mad-vyapāśrayaḥ' — 'vyapāśraya' is a very strong compound, meaning one who has taken absolute, complete, thorough shelter in the Lord. The prefix 'vi' intensifies 'apa-āśraya' — shelter — to indicate total, undivided reliance. This is not the refuge of someone who also has other resources; this is one-pointed, exclusive refuge. The condition is total surrender; the result is the eternal state by divine grace. This mirrors verse 66 which is still to come — the mahā-vākya of the Gita's surrender teaching. Even now, in verse 56, the seed of that supreme surrender is planted. 'Śāśvatam padam avyayam': padam can mean both 'state' and 'abode' — the commentary tradition thus reads it both as liberation during life (jīvan-mukti) and the transcendent state beyond death (videha-mukti)."

'Mat-paraḥ' — making Me the highest, the ultimate telos of one's life. Not wealth, not pleasure, not even liberation as a personal achievement — but God as the supreme end. 'Buddhi-yogam upāśritya' — taking refuge in the yoga of buddhi: the alignment of the discriminating intelligence with the divine will.

'Cetasā' — with the mind; this is where religion lives. 'Sarva-karmāṇi mayi sannyasya' — Sannyāsa (renunciation) here is not the orange robe; it is the inner offering. Kṛṣṇa is here teaching that one can be the world's most active person and simultaneously be a sannyāsī — through this inner surrender. 'Buddhi-yogam upāśritya': the buddhi-yoga is the discriminating awareness that sees the real amid the unreal, that continuously chooses the divine over the merely pleasant. 'Mac-cittaḥ satataṃ bhava': 'satatam' means without break, without interruption. This is the standard — not 'sometimes think of Me' but always. Brother Lawrence called it 'the practice of the presence of God' — the same teaching in different words.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansaji described this verse as the complete methodology of spiritual life condensed into two lines.

He used to say: when you work, let the hands belong to God; when you speak, let the words be God's; when you think, let the thoughts arise in God's mind. This is what 'cetasā sannyasya' means — the total consecration of the inner life. 'Mat-para' — God as the supreme value; everything else is penultimate. 'Buddhi-yogam upāśritya' — relying on the yogic intelligence, the awakened discriminating awareness that the practice of meditation steadily develops. 'Mac-cittaḥ satataṃ bhava': Kṛṣṇa commands Arjuna — and through Arjuna, all of us — to make divine absorption the permanent condition, not the occasional experience.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji draws the reader's attention to the difference between verse 56 and verse 57: verse 56 speaks of taking refuge in the Lord and receiving grace; verse 57 gives the precise mechanism — 'cetasā' (mentally) surrendering all karma. The outer actions continue; the inner disposition is one of total offering. 'Mat-para' is the keystone: when God is genuinely the highest value — not just professed but actually felt and lived — then naturally 'mac-cittaḥ satatam' follows. When God is merely one among many values, the mind oscillates. But when God is truly paramount, the mind finds its natural resting-place. 'Buddhi-yogam upāśritya': Goyandkaji explains this as taking the support of the yoga described throughout the Gita — the wisdom that the Lord is the doer, that all results belong to Him, that the self's nature is pure witness-consciousness."

Two futures laid side by side: 'mac-cittaḥ... mat-prasādāt tariṣyasi' — mind in Me, grace, crossing of all obstacles; or: 'ahaṅkārāt na śroṣyasi vinaṅkṣyasi' — ego, refusal to listen, destruction. 'Sarva-durgāṇi' — literally 'all impassable places.' Life is full of durgāṇi — difficulties that are genuinely impassable by human strength alone. The word comes from 'durga' — a fort, a difficult terrain. What these obstacles are for Arjuna — the grief, the confusion, the weight of the war — each of us has our own version. 'Mat-prasādāt tariṣyasi' — you will cross by My grace. Not by intellectual resolution, not by emotional courage, but by divine grace. And the alternative: ego-driven deafness leads to destruction. The warning is loving, not punitive.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The Lord here speaks as both the most loving guide and the clearest-eyed diagnostician. 'Ahaṅkārāt na śroṣyasi' — not listening because of ego. This is the fundamental spiritual disease: the ego's insistence on its own understanding, its own path, its own timing. It is not intellectual doubt (which is healthy) but egoic stubbornness (which is fatal). 'Vinaṅkṣyasi' — you will perish. Strong word. Yet not a threat: a description. Ego-driven action, cut off from the guidance of the divine wisdom, naturally leads to self-destruction — psychologically, spiritually, often practically. 'Mat-prasādāt tariṣyasi' — but the other path is available always: mind in God, grace operative, crossing assured. The Upaniṣads say 'nāyam ātmā balahinena labhyaḥ' — the Self is not attained by the weak. Here the 'weakness' is ego; the 'strength' is surrender and grace.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw this verse as the personal voice of Kṛṣṇa-Christ speaking directly to each soul. 'Mac-cittaḥ sarva-durgāṇi mat-prasādāt tariṣyasi' — keep your consciousness in the divine; every difficulty of life — physical, mental, emotional, spiritual — will be navigated by grace. Yogananda faced enormous obstacles in his mission in America — financial, organizational, personal. He often returned to this verse: 'By His grace, we will cross.' And the dark alternative: 'ahaṅkārāt na śroṣyasi vinaṅkṣyasi.' The disciple who insists on their own way, who stops listening to the Guru and to God — is destroyed, not as punishment, but as the natural consequence of cutting the divine lifeline. 'Vinaṅkṣyasi' is a future tense of certainty: it will happen. Ego is not merely an obstacle; unchecked, it is a destroyer.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji notes the return of 'mac-cittaḥ' from verse 57 — Kṛṣṇa repeats this phrase to show the unbroken thread: the instruction of verse 57 (mac-cittaḥ satataṃ bhava) and the promise of verse 58 (mac-cittaḥ... tariṣyasi) are directly connected. Keep the mind in God — this is both the instruction and the condition for grace. 'Sarva-durgāṇi' includes all obstacles of the spiritual path: doubt, dryness, temptation, past karma, the pressure of worldly life. 'Mat-prasādāt' — divine grace is not arbitrary; it flows where the channel is open. Mind fixed on God = open channel = grace flows = obstacles crossed. 'Ahaṅkārāt na śroṣyasi vinaṅkṣyasi': this second half is the starkest compassionate warning in the Gita. The Lord loves Arjuna enough to tell him the terrible truth about ego's consequences."

Arjuna believes he is making a free choice: 'I will not fight.' Kṛṣṇa responds: that choice is an illusion. You are not free in the way you imagine. 'Prakṛtis tvāṃ niyokṣyati' — your own nature will compel you. The kshatriya nature, shaped by countless lifetimes of warrior dharma, will express itself regardless of Arjuna's momentary mental resolution. This is not fatalism; it is the teaching of svabhāva. We are not blank slates making free choices — we are beings with a nature, a character, a dharma. True freedom is not in refusing one's nature but in fulfilling it consciously, without ego-identification. Interestingly, the ego's refusal to fight is itself a subtler form of ego than the apparent aggression of fighting. The real battle is inner.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse engages one of the deepest questions in philosophy: free will and determinism. Kṛṣṇa does not say Arjuna has no freedom; He says that Arjuna's imagined freedom — the ego's decision 'I will not fight' — is a surface phenomenon overlying a much deeper determinism of character and karma. 'Ahaṅkāram āśritya' — taking refuge in ego. The irony is sharp: Arjuna thinks his refusal to fight is compassion (karuṇā) and wisdom (jñāna), but Kṛṣṇa has been showing throughout the Gita that it is actually ahaṅkāra — the ego's confusion, the ego's sorrow, the ego's limited perspective. True freedom comes not from the ego asserting itself against one's nature, but from the Self (ātman) transcending and illuminating the ego. 'Prakṛtis tvāṃ niyokṣyati': nature will yoke you. The yoke is real; the question is whether you carry it consciously or are dragged by it.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansaji taught that each soul comes into incarnation with a specific pattern of karma and svabhāva that shapes its life-path. This is not punishment; it is the precision of divine law. 'Ahaṅkāram āśritya na yotsye iti manyase' — taking shelter in the ego, thinking 'I will not fight.' The ego always mistakes its reactions for choices. Arjuna's recoil from battle felt to him like a noble decision; Kṛṣṇa shows it is the ego's confusion dressed as wisdom. 'Mithyaiṣa vyavasāyaḥ' — this determination is false. Not false in an insulting sense but in the sense of being based on a mistaken premise: the premise that the ego is the true decision-maker. 'Prakṛtis tvāṃ niyokṣyati' — your nature will engage you. And if you do not engage consciously and freely, nature will compel you. The invitation is to act freely — as the Self — rather than be driven compulsorily as the ego.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji reads this verse in the light of Chapter 3's teaching on svabhāva and karma. Every being acts according to its nature — 'sadṛśaṃ ceṣṭate svasyāḥ prakṛter jñānavān api' (3.33): even the wise act according to their nature. Arjuna's nature is the kshatriya nature: disciplined, courageous, protective of dharma. This nature, formed over many lifetimes, will assert itself regardless of his momentary decision. 'Mithyā vyavasāya' — the false resolve. It is the ego that imagines it can override svabhāva through a mental declaration. The deep teaching is paradoxical: true freedom is found not in fighting against one's nature but in fulfilling one's nature without ego-attachment — which is precisely what the Gita's karma-yoga teaches. The warrior who fights with ego accumulates binding karma; the warrior who fights with inner surrender is free even while fighting."

Arjuna is being shown the logical conclusion of ignoring the Gita's teaching: if he refuses to act according to his dharma with inner freedom and surrender, he will still act — but compelled by his own nature, without inner freedom, driven like a puppet. The karma born of svabhāva (svabhāva-jena karmaṇā) is the accumulated conditioning of one's entire spiritual history. It is vastly more powerful than a momentary mental resolution. 'Mohāt na icchasi' — you do not wish to do it because of moha, delusion. Moha is the root: the confusion that makes one unable to see clearly what is real and what is one's true duty. Kṛṣṇa's entire teaching has been the antidote to moha. 'Kariṣyasi avaśaḥ api tat' — you will do it anyway, helplessly. The choice is not whether to act, but whether to act freely or compelled.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is the culmination of the teaching on svabhāva that runs through Chapter 18. 'Svabhāva-jena karmaṇā nibaddhaḥ' — bound by action born of one's own nature. The binding here is not an external prison but the internal structure of one's own being — one's own accumulated impressions, tendencies, the guṇa-composition of one's character. Ramakrishna used to say: 'One's own mind is one's greatest enemy and one's greatest friend.' When the mind is purified and aligned with the divine, it becomes the friend; when dominated by moha and ego, it becomes the binding karma that drives one helplessly. 'Mohāt na icchasi... avaśaḥ kariṣyasi' — the deluded mind refuses; the deeper nature compels. The Gita's solution is not to suppress nature but to transcend ego, so that one's actions flow from the Self rather than from compulsion. Then 'avaśa' (helpless) becomes 'vaśa' — master of oneself.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda saw in this verse a profound teaching about karma and consciousness. 'Svabhāva-jena karmaṇā nibaddhaḥ' — bound by the karma of one's own nature. Each soul carries its unique karmic pattern — its 'soul blueprint,' as Yogananda called it — shaped by past incarnations. This blueprint is not destiny in a fatalistic sense; it is the starting point of freedom. When we act from ego and moha, we remain bound — 'avaśaḥ,' helplessly driven. But when we act from the Self — mac-cittaḥ, as God's instrument — we begin to dissolve the karmic patterns rather than reinforce them. 'Kariṣyasi avaśaḥ api tat': even the refusal to act is, in the compelled person, a form of action — one will fight anyway, driven by the kshatriya nature. True freedom is found only in conscious, God-surrendered action. This is the entire Gita in miniature.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandkaji notes that this verse completes the argument begun in verse 59 and echoes Chapter 3's 'sadṛśaṃ ceṣṭate svasyāḥ prakṛter' (3.33). 'Svabhāva-jena karmaṇā nibaddhaḥ': karma here means not just past action but the entire complex of tendencies, inclinations, and drives that arise from one's nature. Arjuna is a kshatriya to the core — his very prāṇas know how to fight. 'Mohāt na icchasi' — the 'not-wishing' is born of moha, not of genuine vairāgya (dispassion) or jñāna (wisdom). Genuine dispassion would be: 'I will fight without attachment to outcome.' Moha-driven refusal is: 'I cannot bear the consequences, therefore I will not act.' 'Kariṣyasi avaśaḥ api tat' — even so, you will do it, helplessly. The Gita's teaching is thus: act, but act freely; surrender the fruits; keep the mind in God; then avaśa becomes vaśa, compulsion becomes freedom, karma becomes yoga."
