      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "Baba would pause here and say, 'This is His personal promise to us.' The word dhāma — abode — is so intimate. It is not merely a destination; it is where the Lord Himself dwells, and He is inviting us there. Avyakta, unmanifest, and akṣara, imperishable — these two words together point to a Reality that our senses can never grasp but that our heart recognizes when it grows still enough. The great assurance is na nivartante — they do not return. Once the soul touches that supreme light, the restless wandering through lives is over. This verse should fill us with a quiet, steady longing — not a desperate yearning, but the serene certainty that there is a Home waiting for us, and our Beloved lives there.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Here Krishna identifies the avyakta, the Unmanifest, with the akṣara, the Imperishable — and declares it His own supreme dhāma. Advaita Vedanta sees this as pointing to nirguna Brahman, the attributeless Absolute that underlies all manifestation. The phrase 'paramaṃ mama — My supreme Abode' is striking: the personal God (saguna Brahman) is affirming that the attributeless Absolute is His own inner nature. For the Advaitin, reaching this state is not arriving at a place but recognizing one's own true nature as the Imperishable. Na nivartante — non-return — describes moksha, liberation, where the individual illusion of separateness dissolves permanently. There is no 'going' anywhere; there is only the cessation of the misconception that we were ever separate.",
        "yogananda": "The Unmanifest Imperishable is the Cosmic Consciousness that underlies and pervades all vibratory creation. When the yogi's consciousness ascends beyond all planes of manifestation — beyond astral and causal heavens — it merges into that ever-still, ever-blissful Absolute that Paramahansaji called the Infinite Spirit beyond creation. 'They do not return' describes the soul that has dissolved the last seed of karma and ego-identification. This is not mere metaphysical abstraction — advanced yogis in deep samadhi touch this state and return transformed, knowing from direct experience what death cannot touch. The 'supreme Abode' of the Lord is not a location in space but the omnipresent stillness at the center of every soul's being.",
        "goyandka": "This verse gives the definitive identification of what was called the 'Unmanifest higher than the Unmanifest' in verse 20. That supreme Reality is here named as akṣara — the Imperishable — and paramāṃ gatim — the ultimate Goal. The Gita consistently teaches two levels of liberation: reaching Brahmaloka and remaining there until final dissolution (indirect liberation), and reaching this dhāma paramaṃ — the supreme Abode — from which there is no return whatsoever. Classical commentators note that this is the sasambhava prayāṇa — the total departure — where the jīvātmā is no longer subject to any further birth. The Lord's use of 'mama — Mine' expresses the intimacy between the devotee's ultimate refuge and the Supreme Person Himself."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "After all the cosmic descriptions of paths and planes, Krishna brings it home to the most tender truth: ananya-bhakti — undivided love. You do not need to decode the mysteries of the cosmos or master arcane yogic techniques. You need only love Him completely, with nothing held back and no other refuge sought. 'In whom all beings abide' — this means every living soul is already resting inside the Lord's being right now. We are always held. We simply need to turn our attention to the One who is holding us. Baba used to say, 'He is the only Relative who never leaves.' That is the ananya of ananya-bhakti — when the heart sees that there is simply no one else.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is one of the most important in the entire Gita because it subordinates all other paths to bhakti when it comes to realizing the Supreme Purusha. Ananya-bhakti — non-dual or non-exclusive devotion — is not mere emotional piety; it is the recognition that the devotee, the object of devotion, and the act of devotion are ultimately one reality. The description 'yena sarvam idaṃ tatam — by whom all this is pervaded' echoes the famous mahavakya Sarvam khalv idaṃ Brahma — all this is indeed Brahman. The Supreme is both the transcendent ground (yasyāntaḥ-sthāni bhūtāni) and the immanent pervader. Bhakti that rests in this non-dual understanding is what qualifies as ananya.",
        "yogananda": "The path of devotion and the path of yoga are not ultimately separate. Paramahansaji taught that true ananya-bhakti is the complete offering of the ego — the annihilation of the little self in the fire of divine love. The scientific yogi who has discovered through meditation that the Divine Consciousness underlies and pervades every atom of creation — 'yena sarvam idaṃ tatam' — naturally finds all love flowing to that one Source. This is not blind faith but verified experience. The cosmic consciousness that the yogi touches in samadhi is the very Being described here: containing all creatures within Itself, pervading all space and time. To know Him thus is to love Him totally.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita's consistent teaching is that while the Unmanifest Absolute is the highest truth, it is most directly approached through the personal relationship of devotion. Here Krishna explicitly states: bhaktyā labhyaḥ — attainable by devotion. The qualifier ananyayā is crucial: it means devotion that is exclusive, that does not run after secondary enjoyments or partial goals. The Gita Press commentary emphasizes that this verse does not contradict jñāna or yoga but shows that ananya-bhakti is their fulfillment. The description of the Supreme as the container of all beings (yasyāntaḥ-sthāni) and the pervader of all (yena tatam) establishes that He is both the inner reality and the outer totality — the complete Brahman, accessible through love."

        "dadaji": "Here Krishna, like a loving guide, says: 'Come, let Me explain something important to you.' The two words anāvṛtti and āvṛtti — non-return and return — hold the entire mystery of what happens after death. Not to frighten us, but to help us understand: the quality of our inner life, our spiritual attainment, our mode of departing — all of this shapes what comes next. The Lord is not indifferent to our journey. He is spelling out the cosmic laws with the care of a grandfather who wants his grandchildren to travel safely. The very fact that He teaches this shows His compassion — He wants us to choose the path of non-return.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse serves as the preamble to one of the Gita's most discussed passages — the doctrine of the two paths of the departing soul. The tradition recognizes this teaching as having roots in the Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads, where the devayana and pitriyana — the path of the gods and the path of the ancestors — are described. Krishna is framing this as cosmic law: the conditions under which a soul departs influence its post-mortem journey. For the Advaitin, the deeper teaching is not about literal paths through light and smoke, but about the degree of self-knowledge one carries at the moment of death — whether one's consciousness is identified with the Absolute or still entangled in the phenomenal.",
        "yogananda": "The deeper yogic teaching here is about states of consciousness at death. Paramahansaji explained that these paths describe the vibrational quality of the departing soul's awareness: whether it exits through the higher centers (the upward path of light and daytime consciousness) or through the lower centers (the path of smoke and night). The yogi who has mastered pranayama and meditation trains the life-force to exit through the brahmarandhra — the crown — which corresponds to the bright path. This is not superstition but spiritual physiology. The Lord is teaching Arjuna — and through him, all serious seekers — that preparation for death is part of the sadhana of life.",
        "goyandka": "Verses 23-26 constitute the Gita's teaching on the two paths of departure, corresponding to the Upanishadic doctrine of devayana and pitriyana. The classical commentary tradition, including Shankaracharya, notes that these paths apply specifically to upāsaka-yogis — those who have attained a high degree of meditative realization but have not yet achieved full jñāna-mukti. The fully liberated jñānī is not bound by these paths at all; his consciousness merges directly into Brahman at death. For those still on the way, however, the conditions of departure — both internal (level of realization) and external (cosmic time) — do matter. This verse introduces the teaching with the formality of a divine declaration."

        "dadaji": "What a beautiful litany — fire, light, daytime, the bright fortnight, uttarāyaṇa! Each word paints a picture of radiance, of awakening, of the soul moving upward like a flame. These are not mere astronomical facts but living symbols of the inner state the dying yogi carries. The person who dies in the light has lived in the light — they have kept the flame of awareness bright through sadhana and devotion. Brahma-vido janāḥ — those who know Brahman — they go to Brahman. As within, so without. The outer luminous conditions merely mirror the inner luminosity that the soul has cultivated over a lifetime of practice.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Shankaracharya interprets the fire, light, day, and bright fortnight not as literal calendar conditions but as presiding deities and states of consciousness associated with the bright upward path. The soul journeying on this path moves through successively subtler and more luminous planes until it reaches Brahmaloka. Vedantically, brahma-vido — the knowers of Brahman — who depart on this path have realized the saguna Brahman sufficiently to be conducted to the Brahmaloka, from which they eventually attain final liberation at the time of cosmic dissolution. This is the krama-mukti — gradual liberation — as distinguished from the immediate liberation of the fullest jñāna.",
        "yogananda": "These luminous symbols — fire, light, day, the waxing moon, the sun's northward journey — correspond to the upward flow of prāṇa through the spine's awakened centers. The yogi who has reversed the downward flow of consciousness through kriya practice departs with life-energy rising through the sushumna toward the brahmarandhra. This inward luminosity at the moment of death corresponds to the outer symbols of the bright path. Paramahansaji taught that the sun's northern course (uttarāyaṇa) is also the inner 'northern' or upward path of the awakened kundalini. To die in this state — with life-force fully gathered and ascending — is to exit into the divine light.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary identifies this verse as describing the archirādi-mārga — the path of flame — mentioned in the Chandogya Upanishad (5.10.1-2). The sequence agni, jyotiḥ, ahaḥ, śukla-pakṣa, uttarāyaṇa represents both the literal cosmic conditions favorable for a pure departure and the presiding deities who guide the soul upward. Madhusudana Saraswati notes that these conditions apply to those who have practiced upāsanā and dhyāna — worshipers of the saguna Brahman — not to those who have attained full Self-knowledge, who are beyond path and time. The important point is brahma-vido — only those who have truly known, not merely heard about, Brahman take this path."

He reaches the beautiful lunar realms, enjoys the fruits of his merit there, and then — like a plant exhausting its stored water — returns. This is not punishment; it is simply the law of what is incomplete finding its completion. May we each practice with such completeness that nothing calls us back.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse describes the pitriyana — the path of the ancestors — which the soul traverses when it departs with remaining karmic tendencies and desires. The candramasa jyotis — lunar light — refers to Chandraloka, a realm of enjoyment where the soul exhausts its accumulated merit before returning to earth. The Upanishads describe this in detail as the soul passing through smoke, night, the dark fortnight, and the southern direction. Philosophically, the key difference from the bright path is not moral inferiority but completeness of knowledge. The soul on the dark path still identifies with individuality and has residual desires — even virtuous desires. When those are spent, the pull of prakriti reasserts itself.",
        "yogananda": "The dark path of smoke and night describes the descent of life-force through the lower spinal centers at death — the soul's consciousness is still drawn to the astral and causal realms that correspond to the moon's borrowed, reflected light. Such a soul enjoys the astral heavens — the candramasa jyotiḥ — until its spiritual merit is consumed, then must reincarnate to continue its evolution. Paramahansaji taught that the true meaning of returning from the moon is the soul's inability to remain permanently in the higher astral realms because its wisdom-light is insufficient to sustain the expansion. The practice of kriya yoga accelerates the burning of these karmic seeds so the soul need not return.",
        "goyandka": "This verse describes the dhūmādi-mārga — the path beginning with smoke — the pitriyana of the Chandogya Upanishad. The soul traversing this path reaches Chandraloka — the realm of the moon — which is the highest of the pleasurable cosmic realms accessible to those with accumulated virtue and devoted practice but without complete Brahman-realization. The phrase yogī prāpya nivartate is noteworthy: even a yogi — a practitioner of considerable spiritual accomplishment — may take this return path if his practice has not been crowned with Self-knowledge. This teaching motivates the serious seeker not to be satisfied with reaching the highest heavens but to aspire for that knowledge which transcends all paths."

        "dadaji": "Two paths, eternal — this is the cosmic architecture of our journey home. Baba would say these paths are not external roads but inner states. The bright path is the state of the soul that has become light — through japa, satsang, devotion, self-offering. The dark path is the state of the soul that still carries the weight of desire, however beautiful that desire may be. The cosmos simply mirrors what we carry inside. There is no judgment here, only the quiet law: be light, and you go to the Light. Krishna tells us this not to create anxiety but to create clarity. We have a choice, made not in a single moment at death but in every moment of our living.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The word śāśvate — eternal — is significant. These two paths are not historically contingent or culturally constructed; they represent the eternal structure of cosmic law governing the soul's journey through manifestation. Vedanta sees this as the operation of māyā's two powers: āvaraṇa-śakti (veiling) and vikṣepa-śakti (projecting). The bright path corresponds to the diminution of these powers in the soul; the dark path to their continued sway. One path leads to vidyā — knowledge; the other perpetuates avidyā — ignorance. Yet the Gita's ultimate teaching, declared in the next verse, is that the yogi who truly understands transcends both paths — because for the fully realized, there is no path at all, only the recognition of the ever-present Brahman.",
        "yogananda": "These two eternal paths correspond to the two fundamental currents in creation: the outgoing current (extroversion) and the returning current (introversion). All of manifestation moves between these poles. The dark path of return is the natural gravitational pull of maya — consciousness flowing outward and downward into denser expression. The bright path of non-return is the ascent of consciousness back toward its Source, reversing the outflow through yogic discipline. Paramahansaji taught that the entire universe is a school, and these two paths represent the curriculum: souls spiraling outward into experience and spiraling back inward toward God, lifetime after lifetime, until the final return. The kriyaban accelerates this return journey.",
        "goyandka": "This verse confirms that the two paths are not temporary arrangements but sanātana — eternal features of the cosmic order. The Gita Press notes that this corresponds exactly to the Upanishadic teaching of devayana and pitriyana as the two permanent channels through which souls move after departing the body. The verse's structure — ekayā (by one) and anyayā (by the other) — sets up a clear binary: one path leads to final liberation, the other to continued rebirth. This does not mean the dark path is evil; it is simply the path of those still growing. But Krishna's purpose in teaching these verses is to inspire the uttama-adhikārī — the highest-grade aspirant — to strive for the realization that takes one permanently beyond both paths."

        "dadaji": "Krishna draws the lesson cleanly: knowing these two paths, the yogi is no longer bewildered. This is the gift of the Lord's teaching — not fear, but clarity. And then the command, spoken with such warmth: yoga-yukto bhavārjuna — be steadfast in yoga, Arjuna. Not 'occasionally practice yoga' or 'practice when you feel like it.' At all times — sarveṣu kāleṣu. Every conversation, every meal, every breath can be an act of yoga if the heart remembers. The cosmic paths of departure will take care of themselves when we take care of our inner life right now. Baba would say, 'Don't worry about which door you'll leave by. Just make sure the Lord is in your heart when you leave.'",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The phrase 'jānan — knowing' is key. This is not intellectual knowledge but viveka — discriminative wisdom — the yogī's clear understanding of the nature of bondage and liberation. One who truly knows these two paths is not deluded because they see through the entire cosmic theater: both the luminous heavens and the cycles of return are within the realm of māyā. This knowledge immunizes the yogi against being dazzled by either fear of rebirth or craving for cosmic pleasures. The practical conclusion — yoga-yukto bhava — is an injunction to continuous practice. Sarveṣu kāleṣu means not only during formal meditation but in every circumstance of life. This is jīvan-mukti — liberation in life.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansaji would often quote the spirit of this verse: 'Be ever with God.' The yogi who understands the two cosmic pathways sees clearly that all of creation — however magnificent — is still within the domain of change and return. Only the Uncreated is beyond. This understanding does not produce world-weariness but liberating detachment: one can engage fully with life while remaining inwardly free. Yoga-yukto bhavārjuna — be steadfast in yoga at all times — is the master key. For the kriyaban, this means maintaining the inner practice of breathlessness and communion even in activity, so that the moment of death finds the soul already naturally oriented toward the divine Source.",
        "goyandka": "This verse is the practical conclusion of the teaching on the two paths. Krishna does not leave Arjuna with theoretical knowledge alone but drives it into action: tasmāt — therefore — yoga-yukto bhava. The Gita Press emphasizes that sarveṣu kāleṣu — at all times — refers to the three states of waking, dreaming, and deep sleep. The yogi who is truly yoga-yukta maintains the thread of inner union even through sleep and dream. Knowing the two paths removes the spiritual confusion (moha) that causes either worldly attachment or fearful paralysis at the thought of death. Armed with this understanding, the yogi can be fearless in life and fearless in death — always anchored in the practice of union."

All the Vedas, all the sacrifices, all the tapas, all the dana — Krishna says the yogi who has understood His teaching in this chapter transcends the fruit of all of it. Not by dismissing these sacred practices, but by going deeper than their fruits, to the very Source from which all merit flows. Paraṃ sthānam ādyam — the supreme primordial Abode. Ādyam means 'the First' — not first in time but first in Being, the Origin that was never born. This is the promise with which Krishna seals Chapter 8: know these teachings, live them, and you will reach the very beginning of everything — which is also the end of all seeking. May each of us, through the grace of the Lord and the teachings of this holy chapter, find our way Home.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Chapter 8 closes with one of the most sweeping declarations of the Gita. All the merit accumulated through Vedic study, sacrifice, austerity, and charity — extraordinary as these are — produces only finite results, however vast. They lead to higher realms from which one eventually returns. But the yogi who has realized the teaching of this chapter — the nature of Brahman, the paths of departure, the supreme dhāma — goes beyond all these finite rewards to the paraṃ sthānam ādyam: the supreme primordial State. The word ādyam — primordial — is the Gita's final word on the nature of Brahman: it is not a destination one arrives at after a journey, but the very Origin and Ground that was always already here. Realization is not acquisition but recognition.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansaji saw this verse as the glorious summation of the entire chapter's cosmic wisdom. The yogi who has understood the teaching of Aksara Brahma Yoga — the imperishable nature of the soul, the process of cosmic manifestation and return, the paths of light and darkness, the supreme abode — this yogi transcends all the merit of religious observance and reaches paraṃ sthānam ādyam: the primordial divine State. 'Primordial' — ādyam — means the Consciousness that preceded creation, the Eternal Now before time began. This is what the advanced yogi touches in the highest samadhi: not a future reward but the very Source of one's own being. The entire chapter has been building to this: know who you are, and you are already Home.",
        "goyandka": "This concluding verse of Chapter 8 contains a remarkable assurance. All the puṇya-phalam — fruits of merit — declared in the entire corpus of scriptural injunctions: Vedic study, yajña, tapas, and dāna — these are surpassed by the yogi who knows the truth taught in this chapter. The Gita Press commentary notes that idaṃ viditvā — 'having known this' — refers specifically to the knowledge of the Imperishable Brahman, the two paths, and the supreme Abode as taught throughout Aksara Brahma Yoga. The concluding epithet ādyam — primordial — underscores that the supreme Abode is not a newly created heaven but the eternal, beginningless Source of all existence. With this verse, the Lord's teaching on the immortal Absolute finds its perfect and complete expression, inviting every earnest seeker to aspire beyond all transient rewards to that which always was and always will be."
