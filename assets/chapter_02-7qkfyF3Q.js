Dadaji often pointed out that the opening word of Krishna's response to this state is not comfort but a firm, even sharp, challenge: 'From where has this impurity come to you in this crisis?' God does not always soothe our grief — sometimes divine love is expressed as a firm refusal to enable our delusions. The name 'Madhusudana' used here is significant: Krishna is the slayer of Madhu the demon — and Madhu represents the ego's sweet self-indulgence. Before the teaching begins, the very name invokes the divine power that will dissolve Arjuna's delusion.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse is a masterpiece of psychological description. Three things are noted: Arjuna is filled with kṛpā (grief-compassion), his eyes are aśru-pūrṇa (filled with tears and troubled), and he is viṣīdantam (sinking down in despair). These three elements — emotional overwhelm, sensory disruption, and collapse of will — constitute a complete psychological crisis. Krishna is called Madhusudana here — the one who destroys sweetness that has become demonic. Arjuna's attachment to his kinsmen is a form of this 'sweet poison.' The teaching that follows is the antidote.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees Arjuna's tears as genuine spiritual readiness. The eyes filled with tears represent the soul's first recognition that the ego cannot solve life's deepest problems. This is the sacred moment of inner surrender that precedes all true spiritual progress. Krishna, now stepping forward as the divine guru, will use this moment of openness to plant the seeds of eternal wisdom. The name Madhusudana carries a promise: the same power that slays demons can slay the demon of spiritual ignorance.","goyandka":"From a classical perspective, this verse establishes that Arjuna's condition arises from kṛpā (pity/compassion) not cowardice. Kṛpā is a noble quality — yet when it leads to the abandonment of duty, it becomes a spiritual obstacle. The teaching will show that true compassion is rooted in the knowledge of the Atman's immortality. Pseudo-compassion that arises from false identification with the body leads to inaction and adharma. Goyandka carefully notes that Krishna speaks only after fully witnessing Arjuna's condition — this is the guru's way."}},{"verse":2,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nकुतस्त्वा कश्मलमिदं विषमे समुपस्थितम् ।\\nअनार्यजुष्टमस्वर्ग्यमकीर्तिकरमर्जुन ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nkutas tvā kaśmalam idaṃ viṣame samupasthitam\\nanārya-juṣṭam asvargyam akīrti-karam arjuna","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Whence has come upon you, in this crisis, this despondency, this unmanliness?

(From where?) — is the most important question in the Geeta. From where has this darkness come? Not 'How are you feeling?' but 'Where did this impurity enter?' This is how a true teacher responds to a disciple's crisis: not with sympathy that confirms the confusion, but with a penetrating question that begins to cut it at its root. Krishna calls Arjuna's state 'anārya-juṣṭam' — unbefitting a noble soul. He does not coddle Arjuna's grief; he names it precisely as what it is: a lapse from one's higher nature. And then the command: arise. This single word — uttiṣṭha — rings through the entire Geeta.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is Krishna's first direct utterance in the dialogue, and it is notable that he does not begin with philosophy — he begins with a diagnosis. The word 'kaśmalam' means not just sadness but a kind of moral and spiritual pollution — a sullying of one's nature. The phrase 'viṣame samupasthitam' — arisen at this crisis point — suggests that the delusion was always latent; the extreme situation has merely brought it to the surface. From the Vedantic standpoint, the crisis on the battlefield is a mirror held up to Arjuna's inner state. Krishna will not let him avoid this mirror. The call to 'arise' is not merely physical — it is the call to rise from tamas and rajas into sattva, from delusion into clarity.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in Krishna's opening words the divine response to every soul's moment of inner collapse. The battlefield — both the outer Kurukshetra and the inner one — always presents us with this same 'viṣama' moment, this crisis point where our habitual identities fail us. Krishna does not comfort Arjuna's ego; he challenges it. The word 'kaśmalam' points to a darkness that is not natural to Arjuna — it is an intrusion, a foreign pollution. The divine guru never accepts the disciple's despair as a final reality; he sees the light within and demands that the disciple rise to meet it. This verse is the eternal call of the Higher Self to the lower self: 'This darkness is not you — arise.'","goyandka":"Goyandka draws attention to the precise Sanskrit term 'klaibya' implied in Krishna's rebuke — a word denoting unmanliness and incapacity. This is not a gentle or diplomatic opening. Krishna is pointing out that Arjuna has, in this moment, ceased to function as a kṣatriya — a warrior whose very dharma is to face conflict without flinching. The rebuke 'anārya-juṣṭam' is particularly strong: an ārya is one who strives for noble ideals. To yield to this despondency is to fall below one's own stature as a seeker. 'Asvargyam' (not leading to heaven) and 'akīrti-karam' (causing infamy) are the two consequences — both spiritual and social — of Arjuna's intended abandonment of duty."}},{"verse":3,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nक्लैब्यं मा स्म गमः पार्थ नैतत्त्वय्युपपद्यते ।\\nक्षुद्रं हृदयदौर्बल्यं त्यक्त्वोत्तिष्ठ परन्तप ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nklaibyaṃ mā sma gamaḥ pārtha naitat tvayy upapadyate\\nkṣudraṃ hṛdaya-daurbalyaṃ tyaktvottiṣṭha paran-tapa","translation":"Yield not to impotence, O Arjuna — it does not befit you.

'Klaibyam mā sma gamaḥ' — do not go in the direction of unmanliness. And then a beautiful word appears: 'kṣudram' — petty, small, mean. Dadaji used to say with great warmth that Krishna is not insulting Arjuna but reminding him of how vast he really is. Your grief is real, but it is kṣudra — it is too small for who you are. The epithet 'Paran-tapa' — Scorcher of Enemies — placed at the very end of the verse is not ironic; it is aspirational. Krishna is invoking the Arjuna who is capable of burning up all enemies, including this inner one. Arise.","sarvapriyananda":"The combination of 'mā sma gamaḥ' is one of the strongest prohibitive forms in Sanskrit — it is not a gentle 'please don't' but an emphatic 'never go there.' The use of the epithet 'Pārtha' (son of Pṛthā, i.e., Kuntī) at the beginning and 'Paran-tapa' at the end frames the verse with two aspects of Arjuna's identity: his noble lineage and his warrior power. Between these two identities lies the 'kṣudra hṛdaya-daurbalya' — petty weakness of heart — which is the false identity Arjuna has momentarily adopted. Vedānta teaches that our suffering often comes from identifying with a diminished version of ourselves. This verse is a call to return to one's true stature.","yogananda":"Yogananda taught that 'hṛdaya-daurbalya' — weakness of the heart — is not the same as genuine compassion. True compassion is strong and clear; it sees the highest good and acts from that vision. What Arjuna is experiencing is a collapse of the discriminating faculty — his buddhi has been overwhelmed by emotion, and he has confused sentimental attachment with wisdom. The command 'tyaktvā uttiṣṭha' — having abandoned it, arise — is the yoga of this verse. First there must be an act of inner renunciation: letting go of the false refuge of grief. Then there can be the rising: uttiṣṭha. This sequence — renounce and rise — is the template for all spiritual practice.","goyandka":"The classical commentators note that Krishna uses two different terms in verses 2 and 3 — 'kaśmala' (impurity, pollution) and 'klaibyam' (unmanliness) — to attack Arjuna's despondency from two angles: its spiritual dimension and its social/dharmic dimension. One who is polluted by kaśmala cannot perceive truth clearly; one who has fallen into klaibyam cannot perform his duty. The modifier 'kṣudra' (petty/mean) applied to 'hṛdaya-daurbalya' is precise: it means that this weakness is not a great cosmic sorrow but a small, common, conquerable failing. The epithet 'Paran-tapa' at the close is, for Goyandka, a reminder of Arjuna's capacity — he who can scorch enemies externally must now scorch this internal enemy."}},{"verse":4,"sanskrit":"अर्जुन उवाच ।\\nकथं भीष्ममहं सङ्ख्ये द्रोणं च मधुसूदन ।\\nइषुभिः प्रतियोत्स्यामि पूजार्हावरिसूदन ॥","transliteration":"arjuna uvāca\\nkathaṃ bhīṣmam ahaṃ saṃkhye droṇaṃ ca madhusūdana\\niṣubhiḥ pratiyotsyāmi pūjārhāv ari-sūdana","translation":"Arjuna said: How, O Madhusudana, can I fight in battle with arrows against Bhishma and Drona, who are worthy of worship, O destroyer of enemies?","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_04.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"कथम्","transliteration":"katham","root":"ka (interrogative base)","grammatical_form":"Interrogative adverb","meaning":"how / in what way"},{"word":"सङ्ख्ये","transliteration":"saṃkhye","root":"saṃkhyā (enumeration, battle)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, locative singular","meaning":"in battle / in the conflict"},{"word":"इषुभिः","transliteration":"iṣubhiḥ","root":"iṣu (arrow)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, instrumental plural","meaning":"with arrows"},{"word":"प्रतियोत्स्यामि","transliteration":"pratiyotsyāmi","root":"prati + √yudh (to fight)","grammatical_form":"Future, 1st person singular","meaning":"I will fight against / I will counter in battle"},{"word":"पूजार्हौ","transliteration":"pūjārhau","root":"pūjā (worship) + arha (worthy)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, dual, nominative/accusative","meaning":"worthy of worship / deserving reverence"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Arjuna's question here is deeply human and, Dadaji would say, deeply honest. 'How can I shoot arrows at those who deserve my prostration?' The word 'pūjārhau' — worthy of worship — is the key. Arjuna is not a coward; he is a man whose sense of reverence is in conflict with his duty. This is a genuine moral problem, not mere weakness. Dadaji often said that the Geeta does not dismiss Arjuna's question; it takes it with full seriousness and then provides a teaching vast enough to answer it. The names Arjuna uses for Krishna here — 'Madhusudana' and 'Ari-sūdana' — are both names of the slayer: as if Arjuna is unconsciously reminding himself that the one before him does know how to deal with enemies.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse represents a shift in Arjuna's engagement with Krishna. He is no longer simply lamenting — he is now posing a philosophical and ethical question: How is it possible to fight one's gurus and elders? This is a question about the relationship between dharma and personal obligation, between social/familial duty and the warrior's code. The Vedantic tradition notes that Arjuna's question contains its own answer in seed form: the word 'pūjārhau' assumes that Bhishma and Drona's bodies are the men themselves. The teaching of the Atman, which Krishna is about to give, will reframe this entirely — the real Bhishma and Drona cannot be touched by any arrow.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in Arjuna's question the eternal cry of the devotional soul when asked to 'fight' against its own cherished attachments. The gurus Bhishma and Drona represent, esoterically, the deep-rooted habits and venerated thought-patterns that the spiritual aspirant must eventually confront and transcend. How can we raise the sword of discrimination against that which we have worshipped? This is the disciple's dilemma. The answer Krishna will provide is not 'stop revering them' but rather 'understand what is real — the Atman in them is untouched.' The reverence remains; the attachment to form must be released.","goyandka":"Goyandka carefully notes the distinction between 'saṃkhye' (in battle, on the battlefield) and the broader spiritual context. Arjuna's dilemma is grounded in the specific dharmic reality of the kṣatriya: he is honour-bound to fight, yet his teachers Bhishma and Drona stand on the opposing side. The classical tradition recognizes this as a genuine conflict between two legitimate dharmas — the teacher-student relationship (guru-śiṣya dharma) and the warrior's duty (kṣatriya-dharma). The Geeta's resolution lies not in choosing one over the other but in transcending the attachment to outcomes that makes the conflict seem irresolvable."}},{"verse":5,"sanskrit":"अर्जुन उवाच ।\\nगुरूनहत्वा हि महानुभावान्\\nश्रेयो भोक्तुं भैक्ष्यमपीह लोके ।\\nहत्वार्थकामांस्तु गुरूनिहैव\\nभुञ्जीय भोगान् रुधिरप्रदिग्धान् ॥","transliteration":"arjuna uvāca\\ngurūn ahatvā hi mahānubhāvān\\nśreyo bhoktum bhaikṣyam apīha loke\\nhatvārtha-kāmāṃs tu gurūn ihaiva\\nbhuñjīya bhogān rudhira-pradigdhān","translation":"It would be better to live even on alms in this world than to slay these noble-souled teachers.

Arjuna says: 'Even begging is better than this.' There is something noble in preferring poverty to bloodshed, in choosing deprivation over dishonour. But then notice what he says next — 'I would enjoy pleasures smeared with blood.' This is extraordinary self-awareness. Arjuna already knows that if he fights, every pleasure afterward will be tainted. Dadaji said this shows Arjuna's deep conscience — and also his incomplete vision. He sees the blood but does not yet see the Atman. When the Atman is seen, a different kind of clarity emerges: one fights not for enjoyment but as a matter of dharma, without attachment to the fruits.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse presents a classic philosophical dilemma in the form of a forced choice: a life of begging or a life of blood-stained pleasure. Arjuna chooses the former — but the Geeta will show that this is a false dichotomy. The real question is not 'which pleasure to choose' but rather 'who is the one who acts and enjoys?' When Arjuna says 'bhuñjīya bhogān' (I would enjoy pleasures), he reveals his attachment to enjoyment as the metric of a good life. The Vedāntic teaching of nishkāma karma — action without attachment to results — will dissolve both horns of this dilemma. Act from duty; do not calculate enjoyment.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in the image of 'rudhira-pradigdhān bhogān' — pleasures smeared with blood — a profound metaphysical truth. Every pleasure obtained through violence to one's higher nature is indeed bloodstained. The inner aspirant who suppresses spiritual conscience for the sake of worldly gain lives always on such stained pleasures. Arjuna's intuition is correct on the surface level. What is incomplete is his assumption that the only alternative is literal begging. Krishna will show a third way: acting in the world with full energy and engagement, yet inwardly free from the stain of attachment and desire.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes the qualifier 'artha-kāmāṃs tu gurūn' — teachers who are themselves motivated by worldly desires. Arjuna is not presenting Bhishma and Drona as fully enlightened gurus; he acknowledges their imperfection. Even so, they are his teachers and elders, and the śāstras are clear that such persons deserve reverence regardless of their personal attachments. The classical tradition holds that the guru-relationship creates an absolute obligation that supersedes even ethical calculations about who is right or wrong in a given situation. Yet the Geeta's higher teaching will show that this obligation, like all obligations, must be fulfilled with a spirit of detachment from the personal outcomes of one's action."}},{"verse":6,"sanskrit":"अर्जुन उवाच ।\\nन चैतद्विद्मः कतरन्नो गरीयो\\nयद्वा जयेम यदि वा नो जयेयुः ।\\nयानेव हत्वा न जिजीविषामस्\\nते 'वस्थिताः प्रमुखे धार्तराष्ट्राः ॥","transliteration":"arjuna uvāca\\nna caitad vidmaḥ kataran no garīyo\\nyad vā jayema yadi vā no jayeyuḥ\\nyān eva hatvā na jijīviṣāmas\\nte 'vasthitāḥ pramukhe dhārtarāṣṭrāḥ","translation":"Nor do we know which is better for us — whether we conquer them or they conquer us.

He no longer simply does not want to fight — he genuinely does not know what the better outcome would be. 'Na caitad vidmaḥ' — we do not know this. This admission of not-knowing is, paradoxically, a step forward. The Geeta tradition always begins in earnest when the disciple admits he does not know. And then the most poignant line: 'Those by killing whom I would not wish to live — they stand right in front of me.' This is Arjuna's full honesty: killing them would be a kind of self-death. This is when a teacher becomes indispensable.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse reveals Arjuna's genuine epistemic crisis — not just an emotional one. He uses the optative mood 'jayema... jayeyuḥ' — 'we might conquer... they might conquer us' — showing that even the outcomes are uncertain to him. He cannot reason his way through this. The phrase 'na jijīviṣāmaḥ' — we do not wish to live — after having slain the Kauravas is psychologically profound: he cannot imagine a life worth living after such an act. This existential crisis — 'I cannot see the value of continued existence beyond this point' — is precisely the moment the Geeta's teaching is designed to address. Life's meaning and the immortality of the Self are the only answers.","yogananda":"Yogananda read this verse as the soul's honest confession of the limits of ego-based reasoning. The ego can calculate many things, but it cannot calculate ultimate meaning. 'Which is better for us?' — the word 'naḥ' (for us) reveals the ego's framework: what is advantageous to this limited self? But the Self cannot be advantaged or disadvantaged by external outcomes. Krishna's teaching will shift the frame entirely: from 'what is better for us' to 'what is required by dharma and offered to the Divine.' Once this shift is made, the question of who wins or loses becomes secondary.","goyandka":"Goyandka draws attention to the desiderative construction 'jijīviṣāmaḥ' — 'we would not desire to live.' This is a grammatically precise expression of a deep ethical intuition: that some victories are worse than defeat, that some survivals are not worth having. The classical tradition recognizes this as a valid moral feeling but points out that it is based on a false premise — the identification of the self with the body and with relationships formed around the body. The Geeta will demonstrate that the soul's jijīviṣā — desire to live — is eternal and cannot be extinguished by any earthly slaying. This provides the platform from which Arjuna's dilemma can be genuinely resolved."}},{"verse":7,"sanskrit":"अर्जुन उवाच ।\\nकार्पण्यदोषोपहतस्वभावः\\nपृच्छामि त्वां धर्मसम्मूढचेताः ।\\nयच्छ्रेयः स्यान्निश्चितं ब्रूहि तन्मे\\nशिष्यस्तेऽहं शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम् ॥","transliteration":"arjuna uvāca\\nkārpaṇya-doṣopahata-svabhāvaḥ\\npṛcchāmi tvāṃ dharma-sammūḍha-cetāḥ\\nyac chreyaḥ syān niścitaṃ brūhi tan me\\nśiṣyas te 'haṃ śādhi māṃ tvāṃ prapannam","translation":"My nature is overpowered by the taint of grief; my mind is confused about duty.

Why? Because here Arjuna becomes a disciple. 'Śiṣyas te 'ham' — I am your disciple. 'Tvāṃ prapannam' — I have taken refuge in You.' This is the moment of formal surrender, and the Geeta really begins here. Until this moment, Arjuna was making arguments. From here, he asks for teaching. The compound 'kārpaṇya-doṣopahata-svabhāvaḥ' is extraordinary — 'kārpaṇya' means miserliness or wretchedness, the smallness of soul that arises when we cling to what is not ours to keep. Dadaji said this word describes perfectly what happens when we mistake the transient for the eternal: we become small, clutching, confused.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the pivotal point of the entire Geeta. The technical term in Vedānta for this moment is 'śiṣyatva' — the state of being a genuine disciple. Three things are required for śiṣyatva: admission of ignorance, sincere desire to know, and complete surrender to the teacher. All three are present here. Arjuna says: 'I am confused' (dharma-sammūḍha-cetāḥ), 'tell me what is truly better' (niścitaṃ brūhi), and 'I have taken refuge in you' (tvāṃ prapannam). The word 'śādhi' — teach me, command me — is a Sanskrit word of great beauty, implying that the teacher's instruction carries the authority of the śāstra itself. The Geeta's teaching is now authorized by the disciple's own surrender.","yogananda":"Yogananda called verse 7 the 'moment of prapatti' — complete self-offering. He noted that the word 'kārpaṇya' comes from the root meaning 'miser' — one who hoards. The soul becomes miserly when it clings to the ego, to relationships, to outcomes. This hoarding contracts the consciousness and produces the 'doṣa' — the inner impurity — that overwhelms Arjuna's better nature. The remedy is exactly what Arjuna does here: release the grip of the ego entirely and say to the Divine, 'I am yours. Teach me.' This is not weakness — it is the highest form of strength, the warrior's ultimate courage: to surrender completely to the Infinite.","goyandka":"Goyandka's classical analysis highlights the phrase 'niścitaṃ brūhi' — tell me with certainty. This is the disciple's proper request: not speculation or philosophy for its own sake but a decisive, actionable answer. Arjuna has tried reasoning, he has tried emotion, he has tried argument — all have led to confusion. Now he asks for śāstra-based authoritative teaching. Goyandka notes that 'prapanna' is a technical term indicating the highest form of surrender — it is not merely taking shelter temporarily but a complete, irrevocable reorientation of the self toward the divine. When a disciple becomes prapanna, the guru becomes obligated by dharma to give the highest teaching."}},{"verse":8,"sanskrit":"अर्जुन उवाच ।\\nन हि प्रपश्यामि ममापनुद्याद्\\nयच्छोकमुच्छोषणमिन्द्रियाणाम् ।\\nअवाप्य भूमावसपत्नमृद्धं\\nराज्यं सुराणामपि चाधिपत्यम् ॥","transliteration":"arjuna uvāca\\nna hi prapaśyāmi mamāpanudyād\\nyac chokam ucchoṣaṇam indriyāṇām\\navāpya bhūmāv asapatnam ṛddhaṃ\\nrājyaṃ surāṇām api cādhipatyam","translation":"I do not see what can remove this grief that dries up my senses — even if I were to attain an unrivalled, flourishing kingdom on earth, or even lordship over the gods.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_08.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अपनुद्यात्","transliteration":"apanudyāt","root":"apa + √nud (to push away, remove)","grammatical_form":"Optative, 3rd person singular","meaning":"might remove / could drive away / would dispel"},{"word":"उच्छोषणम्","transliteration":"ucchoṣaṇam","root":"ut + √śuṣ (to dry up, parch)","grammatical_form":"Present participle / verbal adjective, accusative","meaning":"that which dries up / withering / parching"},{"word":"असपत्नम्","transliteration":"asapatnam","root":"a + sapatna (rival, co-wife, enemy)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, neuter, accusative singular","meaning":"without rivals / uncontested / supreme"},{"word":"ऋद्धम्","transliteration":"ṛddham","root":"√ṛdh (to prosper, thrive)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, neuter, accusative singular","meaning":"prosperous / flourishing / abundant"},{"word":"आधिपत्यम्","transliteration":"ādhipatyam","root":"adhipati (overlord) + abstract suffix","grammatical_form":"Abstract noun, neuter, accusative singular","meaning":"lordship / sovereignty / supreme dominion"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji used to say that this verse proves Arjuna is not a worldly man. A worldly man, if offered the kingdom of the gods, would stop grieving immediately. But Arjuna says even that would not help. This tells us that his grief is not of the ordinary kind — it is not grief over a lost pleasure but grief that arises from the collision between love and duty, between attachment and conscience. The word 'ucchoṣaṇam' — that which dries up the senses — is vivid and accurate. Grief of this depth does literally dry a person out: it makes food tasteless, sleep impossible, the world grey. Only the Atman-teaching, which Krishna is about to give, can reach into this depth and restore life.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse reveals something important about the nature of Arjuna's śoka (grief): it is not a grief that can be remedied by any worldly acquisition. The escalating scale — from earthly kingdom to lordship over the gods — underscores that the problem is not circumstantial but existential. Arjuna's grief is rooted in avidyā — fundamental ignorance of the Self's nature. No external gain can resolve a problem rooted in inner ignorance. This is why the Geeta's answer is not 'here is what you will gain' but 'here is what you truly are.' The famous teaching of Ātma-vidyā — Self-knowledge — alone addresses grief at this level.","yogananda":"Yogananda emphasized the phrase 'ucchoṣaṇam indriyāṇām' — the drying-up of the senses. In his metaphysical reading, the senses are channels through which the soul experiences the world. When grief of this kind takes hold, these channels dry up — the soul loses its connection to life energy. This is not a metaphor; it is a description of what yogis call prāṇa-kṣaya, the diminishment of vital force. The only remedy is not the injection of more sense-pleasure (more kingdom, more power) but the reversal of the flow — turning the senses inward toward the Self, which is the inexhaustible source of ānanda (bliss). This inner reversal is the essence of yoga.","goyandka":"Goyandka points out the rhetorical structure of the verse: Arjuna presents the most extreme positive scenario imaginable — unrivalled kingdom plus sovereignty over the gods — and declares it insufficient. This is not hyperbole; it is a sincere statement of the depth of his śoka. The classical tradition uses this verse as evidence that the Geeta is not simply a manual for warriors facing difficult decisions; it is a response to the deepest human crisis — the crisis of meaning. When no worldly achievement, however grand, can resolve the inner grief, only the knowledge of Brahman can serve as the ultimate remedy."}},{"verse":9,"sanskrit":"सञ्जय उवाच ।\\nएवमुक्त्वा हृषीकेशं गुडाकेशः परन्तपः ।\\nन योत्स्य इति गोविन्दमुक्त्वा तूष्णीं बभूव ह ॥","transliteration":"sañjaya uvāca\\nevam uktvā hṛṣīkeśaṃ guḍākeśaḥ paran-tapaḥ\\nna yotsya iti govindam uktvā tūṣṇīṃ babhūva ha","translation":"Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus to Hrishikesha, Gudakesha — the conqueror of sleep — said to Govinda: 'I will not fight,' and then fell silent.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_09.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"गुडाकेशः","transliteration":"guḍākeśaḥ","root":"guḍāka (sleep) + keśa (hair, controller) — one who has conquered sleep","grammatical_form":"Compound proper noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"Gudakesha — epithet of Arjuna as conqueror of sleep"},{"word":"न योत्स्ये","transliteration":"na yotsye","root":"na (not) + √yudh (to fight) — future tense","grammatical_form":"Future, 1st person singular + negation","meaning":"I will not fight"},{"word":"गोविन्दम्","transliteration":"govindam","root":"go (cows, senses, earth) + √vind (to find, protect)","grammatical_form":"Proper noun, masculine, accusative singular","meaning":"Govinda — one who protects cows / the senses / the earth; epithet of Krishna"},{"word":"तूष्णीम्","transliteration":"tūṣṇīm","root":"tūṣṇī (silence)","grammatical_form":"Indeclinable / adverb","meaning":"silently / in silence / without speech"},{"word":"बभूव","transliteration":"babhūva","root":"√bhū (to be, become) — perfect tense","grammatical_form":"Perfect, 3rd person singular","meaning":"became / fell into (silence)"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji called this the most dramatic silence in all of literature. After everything — the lamenting, the philosophising, the arguments, the surrender — Arjuna says three words: 'Na yotsye iti' — I will not fight. And then: silence. Dadaji would pause here in his discourse and let the silence fill the room. He said that in this silence, the Geeta is born. When a human being has exhausted all his arguments and said his final word and fallen silent, God can speak. This is the silence of total surrender — not sullen refusal but complete inner emptiness, readiness. The epithet 'Gudakesha' — conqueror of sleep — in this moment of collapse is almost tender in its irony. He who conquers sleep cannot conquer this grief.","sarvapriyananda":"Sanjaya's narrative resumes here after Arjuna's long speech. The three-word declaration 'na yotsye iti' — I will not fight — is, in Sanskrit literature, one of the most famous examples of laghutā (economy of expression). Everything Arjuna has felt and argued collapses into this single refusal. Vedānta's analysis: this is the moment of complete ego-exhaustion that precedes genuine spiritual opening. The ego has made its final stand. It has argued, wept, reasoned, surrendered — and now it declares its final position and goes silent. Into this silence, the divine wisdom of the Geeta will pour. Tūṣṇīṃ babhūva ha — 'he became silent.' This stillness is the womb of the teaching.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in Arjuna's final silence the paradox of the spiritual journey: the moment of greatest outer passivity is often the moment of the greatest inner readiness. 'Tūṣṇīṃ babhūva' — he fell silent. This is not depression but the stillness that precedes reception. The meditative tradition knows this state: when the chattering mind finally exhausts itself, when all the arguments have been made and refuted, a deep silence descends. In that silence, the guru's voice can be heard truly for the first time. Govinda — the protector of the senses and the earth — is addressed in the accusative: Arjuna has directed himself entirely toward Krishna. The pose is complete. The teaching can begin.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes the careful use of the perfect tense 'babhūva ha' — 'he became (silent).' The particle 'ha' is an emphatic that in Sanskrit prose often marks a surprising or significant turn. Arjuna's silence is significant precisely because of what has preceded it: a long, reasoned, passionate speech. The classical tradition teaches that a disciple must fully empty himself of his own views before he can receive the guru's teaching. The 'na yotsye iti' is Arjuna's final assertion of his own will. After this, until Chapter 18, Arjuna will be primarily the receiver of teaching rather than the maker of arguments. The silence of verse 9 is the turning point of the entire Bhagavad Geeta."}},{"verse":10,"sanskrit":"सञ्जय उवाच ।\\nतमुवाच हृषीकेशः प्रहसन्निव भारत ।\\nसेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये विषीदन्तमिदं वचः ॥","transliteration":"sañjaya uvāca\\ntam uvāca hṛṣīkeśaḥ prahasann iva bhārata\\nsenayor ubhayor madhye viṣīdantam idaṃ vacaḥ","translation":"Sanjaya said: O Dhritarashtra, to him who was despondent between the two armies, Hrishikesha, as if smiling, spoke these words.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_10.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"हृषीकेशः","transliteration":"hṛṣīkeśaḥ","root":"hṛṣīka (senses) + īśa (lord, from √īś)","grammatical_form":"Compound proper noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"Hrishikesha — Lord of the senses; epithet of Krishna"},{"word":"प्रहसन्निव","transliteration":"prahasann iva","root":"pra + √has (to laugh, smile) + iva (as if, like)","grammatical_form":"Present participle + particle of comparison","meaning":"as if smiling / seeming to smile slightly"},{"word":"सेनयोरुभयोर्मध्ये","transliteration":"senayor ubhayor madhye","root":"senā (army) + ubhaya (both) + madhya (middle)","grammatical_form":"Genitive dual + locative compound","meaning":"in the middle of both armies"},{"word":"विषीदन्तम्","transliteration":"viṣīdantam","root":"vi + √sad (to sink, despair)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, accusative singular","meaning":"the despondent one / him who was grieving"},{"word":"भारत","transliteration":"bhārata","root":"Bharata (ancestor of the Kuru dynasty)","grammatical_form":"Proper noun epithet, masculine, vocative singular","meaning":"O Dhritarashtra / O descendant of Bharata — Sanjaya's address"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Two words carry this entire verse: 'prahasann iva' — as if smiling. Dadaji would dwell on these words for a long time. What kind of smile is this? Not mockery — Krishna does not mock Arjuna's grief. Not indifference — Krishna is not detached from the situation. Dadaji said it is the smile of one who sees clearly: who sees through the play of māyā to the eternal light beneath, and finds in that vision a deep, quiet joy that cannot be disturbed even by the sight of the greatest human suffering. It is the smile of the Infinite looking at the Finite and saying: 'I know what you are. Let me remind you.' This smile is the beginning of the entire Bhagavad Geeta.","sarvapriyananda":"The word 'prahasann iva' — as if smiling — is one of the most philosophically loaded phrases in the Geeta. Sanjaya says 'as if' — he is not certain. From the outside, from the perspective of the senses and the intellect, one cannot be certain what is happening in the consciousness of the liberated being. The smile suggests complete equanimity: Krishna is unmoved by the drama before him, not because he doesn't care, but because he sees its ultimate nature. The name 'Hṛṣīkeśa' — Lord of the Senses — is profoundly placed here. He who is master of all the senses addresses the one whose senses are drying up from grief. The contrast is the teaching itself.","yogananda":"Yogananda found in Krishna's smile a revelation of the divine nature. The Divine is never anxious, never overwhelmed, never confused about what to do next. In the midst of the greatest human drama — two armies on the verge of mutual annihilation, a great warrior in total inner collapse — the Divine smiles. This smile is the expression of the satchitānanda nature of Brahman: absolute being, pure consciousness, unalloyed bliss. It is this bliss that Arjuna will be guided to discover in himself. The smile of Hrishikesha says: 'Beneath all this tragedy, bliss is your nature. Come, let me show you.'","goyandka":"Goyandka's commentary highlights the setting: 'senayor ubhayor madhye' — in the middle of both armies. This spatial detail is spiritually significant. Krishna does not withdraw from the field to give his teaching in a peaceful hermitage; he speaks in the middle of the conflict, in the charged space between opposing forces. This is the Geeta's enduring message: the teaching is for life in the world, not for retreat from it. The phrase 'viṣīdantam idaṃ vacaḥ' — these words to the despondent one — emphasizes that the entire teaching is a response to human suffering. The Geeta was not given to the already-enlightened; it was given to a despondent warrior on the field of life."}},{"verse":11,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nअशोच्यानन्वशोचस्त्वं प्रज्ञावादांश्च भाषसे ।\\nगतासूनगतासूंश्च नानुशोचन्ति पण्डिताः ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\naśocyān anvaśocas tvaṃ prajñā-vādāṃś ca bhāṣase\\ngatāsūn agatāsūṃś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: You grieve for those who should not be grieved for, yet you speak words of wisdom.

Dadaji called this verse the diagnostic verse of the Geeta: 'You speak the language of wisdom, but you are acting from ignorance.' This is the human condition precisely described: we know the right words, we can quote philosophy, we can discuss spiritual principles — but in our actual lived experience, we are still governed by attachment and grief. The truly wise, Krishna says, grieve neither for the living nor the dead — because they know the Atman is immortal, beyond all change.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda often began his commentary on the Geeta with this verse. It establishes the epistemological basis of the entire teaching: there is a fundamental confusion in Arjuna between his theoretical knowledge (prajña-vāda — words of wisdom) and his experiential reality (grief). The teaching that follows in Chapter 2 is designed to bridge this gap — to transform theoretical knowledge into direct realization. The Vedantic tradition calls this the movement from paroksha jnana (indirect knowledge) to aparoksha jnana (direct, immediate knowledge of the Self).","yogananda":"Yogananda saw this verse as identifying the core human problem: we live in contradiction. We have received wisdom — from scripture, from teachers, from our own intuition — yet our lives are governed by the opposite of that wisdom. We know that the body is mortal and the soul immortal, yet we grieve as if the soul could die. Krishna begins not by offering comfort but by naming the contradiction clearly. This honesty is itself a form of divine grace — for only by seeing our confusion clearly can we begin to dissolve it.","goyandka":"Goyandka's classical analysis notes that Krishna uses the word 'aśocyān' — those who are literally 'ungrievable' — because the Atman, the true Self of all beings, is by its very nature beyond birth, death, and all the changes that ordinarily justify grief. Arjuna grieves for the bodies — which will indeed change and perish. But he calls this grief 'wisdom,' which it is not. A paṇḍita is one whose knowledge has penetrated to the level of reality, not merely to the level of concepts. The verse sets up the distinction between word-wisdom and realized wisdom that the rest of Chapter 2 will develop."}},{"verse":12,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nन त्वेवाहं जातु नासं न त्वं नेमे जनाधिपाः ।\\nन चैव न भविष्यामः सर्वे वयमतः परम् ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nna tv evāhaṃ jātu nāsaṃ na tvaṃ neme janādhipāḥ\\nna caiva na bhaviṣyāmaḥ sarve vayam ataḥ param","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: Never was there a time when I did not exist, nor you, nor all these kings; nor in the future shall any of us cease to be.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_12.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"जातु","transliteration":"jātu","root":"jātu (ever/at any time)","grammatical_form":"Indeclinable adverb","meaning":"ever / at any time — indicating timelessness"},{"word":"नासम्","transliteration":"nāsam","root":"na + √as (to be)","grammatical_form":"Negative imperfect, 1st person singular","meaning":"I did not exist / I was not"},{"word":"जनाधिपाः","transliteration":"janādhipāḥ","root":"jana (people) + adhipa (lord/ruler)","grammatical_form":"Noun compound, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"lords of men / kings / rulers of people"},{"word":"भविष्यामः","transliteration":"bhaviṣyāmaḥ","root":"√bhū (to be/become)","grammatical_form":"Future tense, 1st person plural","meaning":"we shall exist / we will be"},{"word":"अतः परम्","transliteration":"ataḥ param","root":"atas (from this) + para (beyond)","grammatical_form":"Adverbial phrase","meaning":"hereafter / beyond this / in the future"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji loved this verse deeply. He would say: 'Before Krishna teaches what the Self is, He first demolishes the illusion of non-existence.' I, you, these kings — not one of us has ever not been, and not one of us shall ever cease. This is not philosophy for the classroom; this is the lived truth that Dadaji carried in his heart every day. When we fear death — our own or our loved ones' — we forget this. Krishna is speaking not as a man but as the eternal, reminding Arjuna of what he already is. This verse is the foundation of all fearlessness.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse begins the Sankhya section with a statement that is simultaneously cosmic and intimate: 'I, you, these kings — none of us has ever been absent from existence.' Krishna is not referring to the body, which clearly begins and ends, but to the Ātman, which is existence itself. The grammatical construction is deliberate: past, present, and future tense all point to the same reality. In Advaita Vedanta, this is the recognition of sat — pure being — as the ground of all consciousness. The plural 'all of us' is not a contradiction of non-duality; it points to the fact that no apparent individual ever steps outside of Being.","yogananda":"Yogananda interprets this verse as a direct revelation of the soul's eternal continuity. Krishna speaks from the state of cosmic consciousness, where past, present, and future are not separate corridors but a single room of light. 'Never was there a time I did not exist' — this is the yogi's experience in deep samādhi: the vivid recognition that the soul has always been awake. Arjuna, trapped in the dream of mortality and loss, is being gently shown the door out of time. The reference to 'all these kings' affirms that no soul, however seemingly small or great, is ever extinguished.","goyandka":"The Gita Press commentary emphasizes that this verse establishes the eternality of the Ātman as the basis for all dharmic teaching that follows. The word 'jātu' (ever/at any time) spans all three periods of time, indicating that the Self's existence admits no interruption. This is not mere metaphysical assertion but a direct rebuttal of Arjuna's grief: you grieve for those who cannot be killed. Goyandka notes that Krishna includes Himself ('I') and Arjuna ('you') alongside the kings to universalize the teaching — this is not a special truth for warriors alone, but the fundamental fact of all conscious existence."}},{"verse":13,"sanskrit":"देहिनोऽस्मिन्यथा देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा ।\\nतथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥","transliteration":"dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṃ yauvanaṃ jarā\\ntathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati","translation":"Just as the embodied Self passes in this body through childhood, youth, and old age — so too does it pass into another body.

We celebrate it! Then why grieve when the old man lays down one coat and picks up another?' This verse gave him tremendous peace when he lost people he loved. The soul simply continues — childhood, youth, old age, and then a new beginning. The word dhīra — the steady, wise one — is his favorite here. It is not that the wise man does not feel; it is that he sees clearly. Grief clouds the vision. Wisdom sees the soul moving forward, always forward.","sarvapriyananda":"Krishna employs an elegant analogy: the same Ātman that passes through the stages of a single life — kaumāra (childhood), yauvana (youth), jarā (old age) — passes at death into a new embodiment. The analogy is precise because we do not consider the transition from childhood to youth a tragedy; we understand it as natural change while the experiencer remains constant. Death is simply a more dramatic version of the same process. The dhīra — one whose intelligence (dhī) is firm — does not lose this perspective. This verse is a training in metaphysical steadiness, not emotional suppression.","yogananda":"Yogananda writes that this verse reveals the soul's magnificent journey through forms. Each body is a school, each lifetime a grade. The soul graduates, not disappears. He often used the image of a dreamer who changes scenes within the dream — the dreamer is never lost, only the scenery shifts. The wise man (dhīra) is one who has, through meditation and discrimination, learned to identify with the dreamer rather than the dream. Such a one is not confused by death any more than a seasoned traveler is confused by changing trains.","goyandka":"Goyandka draws a precise logical structure here: if we accept that the soul is unchanged as the body moves from childhood to old age within one life, then we must also accept that the soul is unchanged as it moves from one life to the next. The analogy removes the apparent mystery of rebirth and makes it rationally coherent. The term dhīra (steady, courageous, wise) is used here rather than jñānī (one of knowledge) because the quality being tested at this moment is steadiness of mind, not merely intellectual knowledge. Arjuna's challenge is not lack of information but lack of equanimity."}},{"verse":14,"sanskrit":"मात्रास्पर्शास्तु कौन्तेय शीतोष्णसुखदुःखदाः ।\\nआगमापायिनोऽनित्यास्तांस्तितिक्षस्व भारत ॥","transliteration":"mātrā-sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ\\nāgamāpāyino 'nityās tāṃs titikṣasva bhārata","translation":"O son of Kunti, the contact of the senses with their objects brings cold and heat, pleasure and pain — these come and go, they are impermanent.

They are all just guests.' The word titikṣasva — endure — is not about gritting your teeth. It is the patient witness who watches the weather change without confusing himself with the weather. This verse was Dadaji's practical teaching on dealing with difficulty: do not dramatize, do not suppress, simply know it will pass. The soul is the sky; sensory experiences are the clouds. You are the sky. Remember that.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse introduces the concept of titikṣā — patient endurance — which is listed in Vedanta as one of the six inner virtues (ṣaṭ-sampat) required for spiritual progress. Krishna is not advising indifference to experience but a trained non-reactivity to it. The mātrā-sparśāḥ (contacts of sense-objects) produce pairs of opposites: cold-heat and pleasure-pain. The Vedantic student is trained to recognize that the pairs arise and dissolve in the field of body-mind, while the Ātman remains untouched. This discernment — not the suppression of experience — is what Krishna points toward.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw this verse as a direct prescription for spiritual practice. The mātrā-sparśāḥ — the contacts between senses and their objects — are the very mechanism that binds the soul to the wheel of karma. Every reaction, every craving and aversion, deepens the groove of bondage. Titikṣā — endurance — is not passive resignation but the practice of non-reactivity that the yogi cultivates through meditation. When the practitioner can sit in meditation and observe cold, heat, pleasure, and pain as passing phenomena without grabbing or fleeing, liberation draws near.","goyandka":"Goyandka identifies two key qualities of sense-contacts: āgamāpāyinaḥ (they come and go) and anityāḥ (impermanent). These two descriptors together form the classical Vedantic teaching on the transient nature of the phenomenal world. The instruction titikṣasva is practical: knowing that experiences are transient, one should not be thrown into elation or despair by them. Goyandka notes that the two epithets used for Arjuna — Kaunteya (son of Kunti) and Bhārata (descendant of Bharata) — remind him of his noble lineage.

Amṛtatvāya kalpate — he becomes fit for immortality. Not that immortality is new; the Ātman is always immortal. But the mind must become steady enough to realize what is already true. Sama-duḥkha-sukham — equal in joy and sorrow — is not coldness. It is the warmth of a person so rooted in the eternal that nothing can uproot them. Dadaji aspired to this all his life and saw it as the fruit of years of devotion and surrender.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents the fruit of titikṣā from the previous verse: the one who is not afflicted (na vyathayanti) by sensory contacts and maintains equanimity (sama-duḥkha-sukham) becomes fit (kalpate) for amṛtatva — immortality. In Advaita Vedanta, this is significant: immortality is not something gained from outside but the natural recognition of one's own eternal nature when the obscuring agitations of the mind are stilled. The dhīra — the intellectually steady person — is not suppressing emotion but has fundamentally seen through the illusion that gives those emotions their binding power.","yogananda":"Yogananda calls this verse a portrait of the jivanmukta — the one liberated while living. Equanimity in the face of pleasure and pain is not stoic resignation; it is the yogi's achieved state of inner freedom. He notes that sama-duḥkha-sukha mirrors the balanced state of the spine in meditation — neither pulling toward the world nor fleeing from it, but resting in the center. Amṛtatvāya kalpate — he becomes worthy of immortality — is the yogic promise: steady practice leads to a transformation in consciousness where death itself loses its sting.","goyandka":"Goyandka emphasizes that amṛtatvāya kalpate does not mean the person gains immortality (which is already the Ātman's nature) but that they become qualified (kalpate) to realize it. The qualification is equanimity — sama-duḥkha-sukham. As long as the mind swings violently between pleasure and pain, it cannot rest long enough in the Self to recognize its own immortal nature. The epithet puruṣarṣabha (bull among men) is used to remind Arjuna that this ideal of steadiness is the mark of the truly excellent human being — not a state for hermits alone, but the highest human aspiration."}},{"verse":16,"sanskrit":"नासतो विद्यते भावो नाभावो विद्यते सतः ।\\nउभयोरपि दृष्टोऽन्तस्त्वनयोस्तत्त्वदर्शिभिः ॥","transliteration":"nāsato vidyate bhāvo nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ\\nubhayor api dṛṣṭo 'ntas tv anayos tattva-darśibhiḥ","translation":"The unreal has no existence; the real never ceases to be.

Sat and asat — the real and the unreal. The body changes, ages, dies — this proves it belongs to asat. The Self never changes, never ceases — this proves it is sat. Dadaji used a simple image: ice melts, becomes water, becomes vapor — but H₂O never disappears. What seems to end is only a form; what truly is cannot not-be. The tattva-darśibhiḥ — the seers of truth — are not philosophers alone but those who have turned inward long enough to actually see this. Dadaji's life was devoted to becoming such a seer.","sarvapriyananda":"This is arguably the most philosophically dense verse in the Gita and the cornerstone of Advaita Vedanta. The sat-asat distinction maps precisely onto Shankara's vivartavāda: the world of appearances (asat) has no independent existence — it appears in and through Brahman (sat) but has no reality apart from it. The 'conclusion perceived by the seers of truth' (tattva-darśibhiḥ) points to the fact that this is not mere theory but a matter of direct perception — aparokṣānubhūti, immediate experience. The teaching of non-dual consciousness begins here.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in this verse the metaphysical structure of all spiritual seeking. That which changes — the body, the mind, circumstances — belongs to asat; it has no ultimate existence. That which never changes — consciousness itself, the witnessing awareness — is sat, Being. In meditation, the yogi directly experiences this: thoughts come and go (asat), but the awareness that witnesses them does not come and go (sat). This is not a concept to be believed but a reality to be experienced. The tattva-darśins are those who have made this inner discovery through sustained, concentrated practice.","goyandka":"Goyandka carefully notes the logical structure: 'There is no existence of the unreal; there is no non-existence of the real.' These are not merely opposite claims — they are mutually confirming. The asat (unreal, which here means the body and all changing phenomena) cannot truly be because it is subject to beginning, middle, and end. The sat (real, the Ātman) cannot cease to be because it is self-existent. The tattva-darśibhiḥ — seers of truth — have directly verified this through their own realization. The Gita here bases its ethical teaching (fight, do your duty) on a metaphysical foundation: you cannot kill what is real."}},{"verse":17,"sanskrit":"अविनाशि तु तद्विद्धि येन सर्वमिदं ततम् ।\\nविनाशमव्ययस्यास्य न कश्चित्कर्तुमर्हति ॥","transliteration":"avināśi tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idaṃ tatam\\nvināśam avyayasyāsya na kaścit kartum arhati","translation":"Know that by which all this is pervaded to be indestructible.

Everything you see, touch, and know exists within it. And it cannot be destroyed. Not by weapons, not by time, not by death.' This verse gave him a sense of boundlessness — he was not a small man trapped in a body but an expression of something that fills the universe. He said that when you truly feel this, the fear of losing anything — including life itself — simply dissolves. What you truly are cannot be threatened.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is a direct pointer to Brahman — the all-pervading, indestructible ground of existence. Yena sarvam idaṃ tatam: 'that by which all this is pervaded' — the universe does not exist alongside the Ātman/Brahman; it exists within it, as expressions of it. Avyaya — inexhaustible, unchanging — is a key name for Brahman. No action (na kaścit kartum arhati) can produce its destruction because destruction implies something external to it, and there is nothing external to the all-pervading. This is the Upanishadic mahāvākya (great statement) in compressed form: the Self is the ground of all.","yogananda":"Yogananda draws here on the idea of omnipresence — the divine consciousness that fills and underlies every particle of creation. 'That by which all this is pervaded' — this is the cosmic AUM, the vibratory presence of Spirit in all matter. In meditation, as the mind grows quiet, the meditator begins to sense this presence — not as a concept but as a felt reality, a living field of bliss and awareness that includes all forms while being limited by none. The avyaya — the inexhaustible — is what the yogi encounters at the depth of samādhi. No weapon of doubt, no arrow of time can reach it.","goyandka":"Goyandka carefully explains that tat — 'that' — refers to the Ātman introduced in the preceding verse as sat (the real). The Ātman is avināśi (indestructible) because destruction requires a cause external to the thing destroyed. Since the Ātman pervades all (sarvam idaṃ tatam), there is no external agent to destroy it. The word avyaya (inexhaustible/immutable) further reinforces that the Ātman does not deplete, diminish, or transform — it is absolutely steady. The purpose of these logical proofs is practical: once Arjuna grasps that no soul can be destroyed, the moral paralysis of grief over killing in battle loses its ground."}},{"verse":18,"sanskrit":"अन्तवन्त इमे देहा नित्यस्योक्ताः शरीरिणः ।\\nअनाशिनोऽप्रमेयस्य तस्माद्युध्यस्व भारत ॥","transliteration":"antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ\\nanāśino 'prameyasya tasmād yudhyasva bhārata","translation":"These bodies of the eternal, indestructible, and immeasurable embodied Self are said to come to an end.

The bodies end. The Self does not. So go — do what you must do.' This is not callousness about death; it is freedom from it. Nitya, anāśin, aprameya — eternal, indestructible, immeasurable — these three words describe what Arjuna truly is, and what every soul truly is. When you know yourself to be immeasurable, how can the death of bodies unsettle you? Tasmād yudhyasva — therefore fight — is not a command to violence. It is an invitation to live fully and fearlessly as who you truly are.","sarvapriyananda":"The verse brings the philosophical argument to its practical conclusion: the bodies (dehāḥ) are antavantaḥ — finite, destined to end. But the śarīriṇaḥ — the embodied one — is nitya (eternal), anāśin (indestructible), aprameya (immeasurable). Three qualifiers are given: nitya points to the Ātman's existence beyond time, anāśin to its immunity from destruction, and aprameya to its transcendence of all conceptual or sensory measurement. From this three-fold foundation, the instruction naturally follows: fight. Dharmic action becomes possible only when the fear of destroying the indestructible is removed.","yogananda":"Yogananda notes that aprameya — immeasurable — is one of the most significant names for the Self. The soul cannot be measured because it is the very consciousness that does all measuring. The eye cannot see itself; the ruler cannot measure itself. The Ātman is the ground of all measurement. Once a person truly knows this — not intellectually but in lived experience — all grief over death transforms into an expansive joy. Tasmād yudhyasva is spoken to all of us: 'You are immeasurable. Therefore, live your life fully. Do not shrink from its demands.'","goyandka":"Goyandka observes that this verse is the practical conclusion of the preceding chain of arguments (verses 12–17). The logical chain is complete: the Ātman is eternal (v.12), it persists through change (v.13), its contacts with matter are temporary (v.14–15), only the real exists (v.16), it pervades all and cannot be destroyed (v.17) — therefore, Arjuna, the bodies are perishable, the souls are not. Fight. Goyandka stresses that tasmāt (therefore) is a word of logical consequence: the Gita's ethics is always grounded in metaphysics. Right action flows from right understanding of reality."}},{"verse":19,"sanskrit":"य एनं वेत्ति हन्तारं यश्चैनं मन्यते हतम् ।\\nउभौ तौ न विजानीतो नायं हन्ति न हन्यते ॥","transliteration":"ya enaṃ vetti hantāraṃ yaś cainaṃ manyate hatam\\nubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṃ hanti na hanyate","translation":"He who thinks this Self is a slayer, and he who thinks it is slain — both of them fail to perceive the truth.

'It does not slay, it is not slain.' He said this verse is the Gita's answer to our deepest fear — the fear of becoming a cause of harm. Arjuna fears he will kill his teachers and kinsmen. But who is really killed? Only the body changes hands. The Self — that shining light — has never been touched by any weapon, by any grief, by any death. Dadaji said: 'Do not confuse the lamp with the shade. The shade can be removed; the light cannot be extinguished.' This verse has comforted countless grieving hearts.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse, closely parallel to Katha Upanishad 1.2.19, presents the Self's absolute transcendence of all action, including the most extreme action imaginable — killing. The error of both parties is the same: they have superimposed qualities of the body (agent of killing, object of being killed) onto the Ātman, which is neither agent nor object. In Vedantic epistemology this is called adhyāsa — superimposition — the fundamental error that underlies all suffering. The correction is not moral instruction but a shift in understanding: perceive correctly what the Self is, and the error dissolves on its own.","yogananda":"Yogananda connects this verse to the Katha Upanishad's identical statement about the Self. He writes that the Ātman is the pure witness-consciousness that observes all action but is itself untouched by any of it. In meditation, when the mind becomes still enough, the meditator directly experiences this witnessing awareness — present behind all thoughts, all sensations, all actions, yet participating in none of them as a subject or object. The yogi who has touched this state even briefly no longer fears becoming an instrument of harm, because they have seen that the deepest layer of every being is beyond harm.","goyandka":"Goyandka cites the exact parallel in Katha Upanishad (1.2.19): 'hantā cen manyate hantuṃ hataś cen manyate hatam / ubhau tau na vijānīto nāyaṃ hanti na hanyate.' The Gita's verse echoes this directly, confirming that this is not a new teaching but the eternal wisdom of the Upanishads, now applied to the battlefield. The dual form ubhau tau (both of these two) is important: the error is not in one direction but symmetric — both the one who thinks the Ātman kills and the one who thinks it can be killed are equally mistaken. The Ātman is beyond both activity and passivity; it is pure, unmodified, eternal existence-consciousness."}},{"verse":20,"sanskrit":"न जायते म्रियते वा कदाचिन्\\nनायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः ।\\nअजो नित्यः शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो\\nन हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे ॥","transliteration":"na jāyate mriyate vā kadācin\\nnāyaṃ bhūtvā bhavitā vā na bhūyaḥ\\najo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṃ purāṇo\\nna hanyate hanyamāne śarīre","translation":"The soul is never born nor dies at any time.

Dadaji loved to meditate on the four adjectives that describe the Atman: aja (unborn), nitya (eternal), shashvata (perpetual), purana (ancient, primeval). He taught that when we truly absorb this truth — not just intellectually but as a living realization — all fear dissolves. The fear of death is the root of all other fears. When we know the Self is deathless, we live fully, love completely, and act freely without the shadow of existential anxiety.","sarvapriyananda":"This is among the most philosophically precise verses in all of Sanskrit literature. Notice the extraordinary thoroughness of the negations: 'Never is it born; never does it die. Having once been, it will not cease to be. Unborn, eternal, changeless, ancient — it is not slain when the body is slain.' The Atman is described through both positive attributes (eternal, ancient) and negations of change (not born, not dying). This is the Vedantic method: the Self is beyond all categories, yet must be pointed to through both what it is and what it is not. The locative absolute 'hanyamāne śarīre' — when the body is being slain — makes the contrast absolute: whatever happens to the body, the Atman is untouched.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw this verse as the cornerstone of the Geeta's metaphysics and the foundation of the courage Krishna wishes to awaken in Arjuna. When the soul truly knows itself — not just believes, but knows — as ajah (unborn), nityah (eternal), shashvatah (ever-existing), and puranah (ancient beyond time) — then the fear of losing anything or anyone dissolves. We still love, we still care, but without the desperate clinging born of believing that death is real. This is the liberation that comes from knowledge alone.","goyandka":"Goyandka's classical commentary carefully distinguishes the four terms used for the Atman's eternity. 'Aja' (unborn) means it never comes into existence through any cause. 'Nitya' (eternal) means it has no temporal limit. 'Shashvata' (perpetual) means its existence is uninterrupted — unlike some eternal things that might have gaps, the Atman is continuously self-luminous. 'Purana' (ancient/primeval) means it has no beginning in time — it is older than all that has ever been. These four together constitute a complete philosophical proof of the Atman's absolute permanence. The final line — 'not slain when the body is slain' — then follows as an inevitable logical conclusion."}},{"verse":21,"sanskrit":"वेदाविनाशिनं नित्यं य एनमजमव्ययम् ।\\nकथं स पुरुषः पार्थ कं घातयति हन्ति कम् ॥","transliteration":"vedāvināśinaṃ nityaṃ ya enam ajam avyayam\\nkathaṃ sa puruṣaḥ pārtha kaṃ ghātayati hanti kam","translation":"He who knows this Self to be indestructible, eternal, unborn, and undying — how can such a person slay anyone, O Partha?

This verse is not permission for violence — it is a radical dissolution of the very premise behind violence. The one who knows the Self as indestructible cannot be a real killer, because the Self in every being is unkillable. Krishna distinguishes between ghātayati — causing another to be the instrument of death — and hanti — the direct act of slaying. Both are questioned. The wise man who sees the deathless Atman everywhere is beyond this duality. Dadaji taught that this knowing is not intellectual but a lived realization — the fruit of years of sincere practice and surrender to God.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda draws attention to the logical structure here. Krishna has established in the preceding verses what the Self is: nityaṃ (eternal), ajam (unborn), avyayam (immutable). Now he draws the ethical consequence: if this is the nature of the Self, the very concepts of slayer and slain become meaningless at the level of ultimate reality. This is not moral relativism — it is metaphysical precision. The person who has this knowledge (veda — he knows) operates from a plane where birth and death are merely appearances. The Vedantic teaching here is that the real subject — the witness-consciousness — is never an agent. Agency belongs to the body-mind complex, not to Atman.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees this verse as the crowning logical argument of the immortality teaching. Once you truly perceive the Atman as ajam (unborn) and avyayam (undecaying), the very grammar of violence collapses. Who is the killer? Who is the killed? These pronouns point to bodies, not to the Self. The question 'whom does he cause to be slain?' is not rhetorical sophistry — it is an invitation to look directly at what is real. In the inner life, this verse teaches that the meditator who contacts the deathless Self within can never again be fully enslaved by fear. Fear is always fear of death. To know the deathless is to dissolve fear at its very root.","goyandka":"Goyandka presents this verse as the practical culmination of the knowledge of the Atman's nature. The four qualities — avināśinam (indestructible), nityam (eternal), ajam (unborn), avyayam (immutable) — established in the preceding verses are now applied. The one with this knowledge (ya enam veda) is established in tattva-jñāna (knowledge of reality). From that standpoint, the body's apparent death is no more real than the changing of clothes.

He would recite it slowly, letting each word fall like a quiet balm. The analogy is so natural, so utterly human — every one of us has worn out old clothes and put on new ones without a moment's grief. Why, then, do we grieve the changing of the body's 'garment'? He taught that the dehī — the one who wears the body — is eternal and untouched. The body is borrowed, like festival clothes worn for a season. To weep for the worn-out garment while the one wearing it lives on is a confusion that wisdom dissolves. This verse, Dadaji said, is the most merciful verse in all of scripture.","sarvapriyananda":"The garment analogy (vāsāṃsi) is one of the Gītā's most celebrated upamās (similes). Its elegance lies in its accessibility — even a child understands changing clothes. Krishna maps the analogy with precision: nara (the person) : dehī (the embodied Self); vāsāṃsi jīrṇāni (old garments) : śarīrāṇi jīrṇāni (worn-out bodies); navāni gṛhṇāti (takes new ones) : anyāni saṃyāti navāni (goes to new bodies). The parallel is exact. Vedanta teaches that the Self is the witness of all these changes. Just as the person who changes clothes is not the clothes, the Atman is not the body. Death is merely the cosmic wardrobe change.","yogananda":"Yogananda loved this verse for its power to dissolve the terror of death. He taught that the soul, like a traveler who has worn a cloak thin with use, simply lays it aside and puts on a new one fitted to its next journey. The analogy also carries a deeper teaching: the quality of the next garment — the next body — depends on the spiritual evolution attained. The soul that has purified itself through meditation and devotion takes on a subtler, more luminous garment. The soul still bound by karma takes on what its accumulated patterns require. Death need not be feared; it is the moment of changing costume before the next act of the divine drama.","goyandka":"Goyandka examines this verse as the most illustrative of Krishna's pedagogical method: moving from the known to the unknown. Every human being knows the act of discarding worn garments and wearing new ones. The śarīra (body) is presented as precisely analogous — a vesture, a covering, an instrument temporarily assumed by the dehī (the indwelling Self). The word jīrṇa applies to both: the garment wears out through use, the body wears out through age and disease. The Self, however, is not subject to jīrṇatva (decay). Goyandka emphasizes that reincarnation is not a punishment or a reward but a natural transition — as natural as changing one's clothes at the end of the day."}},{"verse":23,"sanskrit":"नैनं छिन्दन्ति शस्त्राणि नैनं दहति पावकः ।\\nन चैनं क्लेदयन्त्यापो न शोषयति मारुतः ॥","transliteration":"nainaṃ chindanti śastrāṇi nainaṃ dahati pāvakaḥ\\nna cainaṃ kledayanty āpo na śoṣayati mārutaḥ","translation":"Weapons cannot cut it, fire cannot burn it, water cannot wet it, and wind cannot dry it.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_23.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"शस्त्राणि","transliteration":"śastrāṇi","root":"śastra (weapon, instrument of slaying)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, nominative plural","meaning":"weapons / bladed instruments"},{"word":"पावकः","transliteration":"pāvakaḥ","root":"√pū (to purify) → pāvaka (the purifier)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"fire / Agni, the purifying one"},{"word":"क्लेदयन्ति","transliteration":"kledayanti","root":"√klid (to become wet), causative","grammatical_form":"Verb, causative, present, third person plural","meaning":"wet / moisten / make damp"},{"word":"आपः","transliteration":"āpaḥ","root":"āp (water, the waters)","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, nominative plural","meaning":"waters / water as element"},{"word":"मारुतः","transliteration":"mārutaḥ","root":"Marut (wind-deity)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"wind / Vayu, the wind-god"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji would recite this verse in his quiet voice and then sit in silence. The four great elements — earth's weapons, fire, water, wind — are the very fabric of the material universe. And yet none of them can touch the Atman. How extraordinary that the Self, which seems so fragile when clothed in flesh, is in truth invulnerable to everything the world contains. He taught that this is not mythology but lived experience: in the deepest states of meditation, one glimpses a presence that is untouched by heat or cold, by love or loss, by praise or blame. That presence is the Self. Once you have tasted it, even briefly, fear loses its grip forever.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse deploys the four classical elements recognized in Indian cosmology — earth (implied by śastra, the metal of weapons), fire (pāvaka), water (āpaḥ), and wind (mārutaḥ) — and declares the Atman beyond all of them. This is philosophically precise: the Atman is not composed of the pañcabhūtas (five elements), so the agents of these elements have no purchase on it. Śaṅkarācārya notes that the verse addresses both the gross body's instruments of destruction (weapons) and the subtle elements (fire, water, wind). The repetition of na (not) four times — nainaṃ... nainaṃ... na cainaṃ... na — creates an emphatic fourfold negation that is among the most powerful in all of Sanskrit literature.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw this verse as the cornerstone of fearlessness. He taught that the yogi who meditates deeply begins to experience the Atman as a field of pure awareness — witnessing but never touched by the body's sensations. Cold does not truly enter it; heat does not scorch it; grief does not saturate it. These are experiences of the body and the nervous system, not of the Self. The advanced meditator learns to remain in this inner center even while the body goes through its changes. This is the practical meaning of the verse: not a doctrine to be believed but a state to be realized through sustained inner practice and longing for the Divine.","goyandka":"Goyandka approaches this verse as a systematic refutation of materialism regarding the Self. Each element represents a mode of physical destruction: weapons represent mechanical force (bhedana — cleaving), fire represents thermal destruction (dahana — burning), water represents dissolution (kledana — wetting/dissolving), and wind represents desiccation (śoṣana — drying out). The Atman is immune to all four modes. This is because the Atman is nirguṇa — without the guṇas (qualities of prakṛti) that make material things susceptible to these forces. What has no material composition cannot be materially destroyed. This verse should fill the aspirant with awe and deep reassurance about the nature of the Self."}},{"verse":24,"sanskrit":"अच्छेद्योऽयमदाह्योऽयमक्लेद्योऽशोष्य एव च ।\\nनित्यः सर्वगतः स्थाणुरचलोऽयं सनातनः ॥","transliteration":"acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam akledyo 'śoṣya eva ca\\nnityaḥ sarva-gataḥ sthāṇur acalo 'yaṃ sanātanaḥ","translation":"This Self is uncleavable, it cannot be burned, it cannot be wetted, it cannot be dried — it is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, and primordially existing.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_24.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अच्छेद्यः","transliteration":"acchedyaḥ","root":"a + √chid (to cut/cleave)","grammatical_form":"Gerundive with negative prefix, nominative, masculine","meaning":"that which cannot be cut / uncleavable"},{"word":"सर्वगतः","transliteration":"sarva-gataḥ","root":"sarva (all) + √gam (to go) → gata (gone/pervading)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, nominative, masculine singular","meaning":"all-pervading / present everywhere"},{"word":"स्थाणुः","transliteration":"sthāṇuḥ","root":"√sthā (to stand) → sthāṇu (a post, immovable)","grammatical_form":"Noun used as adjective, nominative, masculine singular","meaning":"stable / firm like a pillar / immovable post"},{"word":"अचलः","transliteration":"acalaḥ","root":"a + √cal (to move)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, nominative, masculine singular","meaning":"unmoved / without motion / absolutely still"},{"word":"सनातनः","transliteration":"sanātanaḥ","root":"sanā (from of old) + tana (extended) → sanātana","grammatical_form":"Adjective, nominative, masculine singular","meaning":"eternal / primordially existing / from the beginningless past"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Verse 23 told us what cannot harm the Self; verse 24 now tells us what the Self positively is — and the list is magnificent. Nityaḥ: it never started, so it can never stop. Sarva-gataḥ: it is everywhere, so it can never be lost. Sthāṇuḥ: firm as a pillar, unshaken by any storm. Acalaḥ: utterly still within, even as the world rushes past. Sanātanaḥ: older than time itself. Dadaji used to say that when a person truly absorbs these seven qualities into their heart — not as philosophy but as recognition of their own deepest nature — a great rest comes over them. The restlessness of the ego, the seeking and fearing, begins to quiet. This verse is a portrait of what you truly are, beneath all the noise.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the positive counterpart to verse 23's fourfold negation. There, Krishna says what cannot affect the Atman. Here, he says what the Atman is. Seven qualities are listed: acchedya, adāhya, akledya, aśoṣya (the four negatives from v.23 restated as compound adjectives), then nityaḥ, sarva-gataḥ, sthāṇuḥ, acalaḥ, and sanātanaḥ. Note the pair sthāṇuḥ (stable, like a fixed post) and acalaḥ (without movement) — these are not identical. Sthāṇu emphasizes structural stability; acala emphasizes dynamic stillness. The Atman is not merely stable because nothing pushes it — it is intrinsically, constitutively unmoving. Sanātana — primordially ancient — is the word from which 'Sanātana Dharma' (the eternal religion) takes its name.","yogananda":"Yogananda meditates on sarva-gataḥ — all-pervading — as the quality that makes the Atman simultaneously one's innermost Self and the Self of all beings. When the meditator breaks through the surface of individual consciousness in deep samādhi, what is discovered is not a separate personal soul but a boundless ocean of awareness that interpenetrates everything. This is sarva-gataḥ — gone into all, pervading all. The stillness described as sthāṇuḥ and acalaḥ is not the stillness of absence but the stillness of infinite fullness — like the ocean in its depths, unshaken beneath its own waves. Sanātanaḥ connects the individual Atman to the primordial Being — Brahman — that existed before the first vibration of creation.","goyandka":"Goyandka carefully analyzes the relationship between verses 23 and 24. Verse 23 establishes the Self's imperviousness through description of actions that fail: weapons cannot cut, fire cannot burn, and so on. Verse 24 reaffirms these as essential qualities — not contingent facts — using the gerundive form with the negative prefix: acchedyaḥ (that which is by nature uncuttable), adāhyaḥ (that which is by nature unburnable). The verse then adds five positive attributes: nityaḥ (eternal — transcending time), sarva-gataḥ (omnipresent — transcending space), sthāṇuḥ (stable — unchanging in relation to things), acalaḥ (immovable — unaffected by any force), sanātanaḥ (primordially existing — without beginning or cause). This sevenfold description is among the most complete ontological accounts of Brahman-Atman in the Upaniṣadic tradition."}},{"verse":25,"sanskrit":"अव्यक्तोऽयमचिन्त्योऽयमविकार्योऽयमुच्यते ।\\nतस्मादेवं विदित्वैनं नानुशोचितुमर्हसि ॥","transliteration":"avyakto 'yam acintyo 'yam avikāryo 'yam ucyate\\ntasmād evaṃ viditvainaṃ nānuśocitum arhasi","translation":"This Self is said to be unmanifest, unthinkable, and unchangeable.

Dadaji found great beauty in the word ucyate — 'it is said to be.' It is a reminder of the lineage: this wisdom did not originate with Krishna alone; it is the accumulated testimony of all the seers who glimpsed the Self and returned to say what they had seen. Avyakta: it cannot be seen with the eyes. Acintya: it cannot be captured by thought — the very organ we normally use to understand has no grip here. Avikārya: it never changes. And so, to grieve for it is to have confused it with something entirely other than what it is. Knowing this rightly — evaṃ viditvā — grief becomes simply impossible.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda highlights the epistemological progression in this verse. Having established what the Atman is (eternal, all-pervading, stable) in v.24, Krishna now addresses how it is known — or rather, how it cannot ordinarily be known. Avyakta: it does not manifest to the sense organs (indriya). Acintya: it cannot be an object of thought (manas, buddhi). Avikārya: it admits no modification that would allow it to be traced through change. These three qualities map onto the three instruments of ordinary knowing: perception (for the visible), inference (for the thinkable), and analogy through change. The Atman transcends all three. It is known only through the Upaniṣadic testimony (śabda-pramāṇa) and the direct experiential realization it points toward.","yogananda":"Yogananda emphasizes acintya — beyond thought — as the most practically important of the three qualities in this verse. He taught that the mind, by its very nature, can only grasp objects. The Atman is the subject — the pure knower — and can never become an object of knowing in the ordinary sense. This is why meditation must ultimately move beyond thought: the meditator has to let go even of subtle concepts and rest in pure awareness. Avyakta means it cannot be seen; acintya means it cannot be thought; avikārya means it has no history, no story, no change to track. Yet it is the most real thing that exists. Yoga is the art of knowing the unknowable — not by grasping but by becoming.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that this verse completes the cycle of teaching about the Atman's nature that began at verse 17. The Atman has now been described as avināśī (indestructible), nitya (eternal), aja (unborn), avyaya (immutable), acchedya, adāhya, akledya, aśoṣya (four imperviousness qualities), sarva-gata (omnipresent), sthāṇu (stable), acala (immovable), sanātana (primordial), and now avyakta (unmanifest), acintya (unthinkable), avikārya (unchangeable). The cumulative force of all these qualities — conveying what the Atman is not and what it positively is — leads to the inescapable practical conclusion: tasmāt nānuśocitum arhasi — 'therefore you ought not to grieve.' The teaching is complete. Grief is revealed as a cognitive error rooted in identification with the perishable."}},{"verse":26,"sanskrit":"अथ चैनं नित्यजातं नित्यं वा मन्यसे मृतम् ।\\nतथापि त्वं महाबाहो नैवं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥","transliteration":"atha cainaṃ nitya-jātaṃ nityaṃ vā manyase mṛtam\\ntathāpi tvaṃ mahā-bāho naivaṃ śocitum arhasi","translation":"Even if you think that the Self is perpetually born and perpetually dies — even then, O mighty-armed, you should not grieve for it.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_26.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"नित्यजातम्","transliteration":"nitya-jātam","root":"nitya (always/eternal) + √jan (to be born)","grammatical_form":"Compound, accusative, neuter singular","meaning":"perpetually born / being born again and again"},{"word":"मन्यसे","transliteration":"manyase","root":"√man (to think, to believe)","grammatical_form":"Verb, present, second person singular, middle voice","meaning":"you believe / you suppose / you think"},{"word":"मृतम्","transliteration":"mṛtam","root":"√mṛ (to die)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, accusative, neuter singular","meaning":"dead / one who has died / dying"},{"word":"महाबाहो","transliteration":"mahā-bāho","root":"mahā (great) + bāhu (arm)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, vocative, masculine singular","meaning":"O mighty-armed one — epithet of Arjuna"},{"word":"तथापि","transliteration":"tathāpi","root":"tathā (thus/even so) + api (even/also)","grammatical_form":"Conjunctive adverb","meaning":"even so / nevertheless / even then"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Here Krishna does something remarkable — he concedes the opposing philosophical position and shows that grief is unreasonable even from that standpoint. 'Even if you insist on believing in perpetual birth and death,' he says, 'even then, grief does not make sense.' Dadaji admired this move deeply. A wise teacher does not demand that the student first accept the entire philosophy before the teaching becomes useful. The address mahā-bāho — O mighty-armed — is significant: it is a reminder of Arjuna's inherent strength and greatness, a call to live up to who he truly is. Even on purely conventional grounds — even accepting the cycle of perpetual birth and death — constant grief for what must always happen is not a worthy response for such a one.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse introduces a rhetorical strategy called tarka or hypothetical concession. Krishna says: 'Even if you don't accept my Vedantic position — even if you hold the Sāṃkhya view that the jīva is perpetually born and perpetually dies — the conclusion remains the same: grief is not warranted.' This is intellectually generous. The Gītā's teaching is strong enough that it does not depend on the listener first accepting its metaphysical premises. The word nitya-jātam (perpetually born) and nityaṃ mṛtam (perpetually dying) may also be a deliberate refutation of the Cārvāka materialist view that consciousness is produced anew each life and dies with the body. Even granting such a view, perpetual mourning for a perpetual process is irrational.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees this verse as Krishna's compassion for all spiritual levels. For the devotee who has not yet realized the Atman's immortality, Krishna offers a second line of reasoning: even if birth and death are a constant cycle, they are a cycle — not a tragedy. Grief implies that something has gone permanently wrong. But if dying is as natural and constant as breathing, why weep at any single breath? Yogananda taught that this verse is for those who are not yet ready to leap to the highest Vedantic view — it meets the student where they are and shows that peace is accessible from there too. The compassionate guru finds a path for every seeker.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that Krishna here employs a logical device: he presents the adversary's position (the belief in perpetual birth and death, possibly the view of the Mīmāṃsakas or materialists) and demonstrates that even this view does not support grief. The argument is: if the jīva is born perpetually (nitya-jātam) and dies perpetually (nityaṃ mṛtam), then birth and death are simply the natural condition of existence — a law, not a loss. To grieve is to wish that a universal law were otherwise, which is futile. What is inevitable and universal cannot serve as a rational ground for personal sorrow. The practical conclusion — naivaṃ śocitum arhasi — is the same whether one accepts Vedānta or not."}},{"verse":27,"sanskrit":"जातस्य हि ध्रुवो मृत्युर्ध्रुवं जन्म मृतस्य च ।\\nतस्मादपरिहार्येऽर्थे न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥","transliteration":"jātasya hi dhruvo mṛtyur dhruvaṃ janma mṛtasya ca\\ntasmād aparihārye 'rthe na tvaṃ śocitum arhasi","translation":"For whoever is born, death is certain; and for whoever has died, birth is certain.

Death follows birth as night follows day. And birth follows death — because the Self, having vacated one form, will take another. This is the wheel, and the wheel turns without exception. Dadaji used to say: 'We grieve as if death were an injustice done to a specific person. But death is the most democratic of laws — it comes to all, makes no distinctions, and arrives exactly on time.' The word dhruvaḥ — certain, fixed — is the same root as Dhruva, the North Star, the most fixed point in the sky. Death is that fixed. And therefore, said Dadaji, our energy is far better spent on living rightly than on grieving for what cannot be otherwise.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda calls this verse an example of anvaya-vyatireka logic: if born, then necessarily death (anvaya: positive correlation); if dead, then necessarily rebirth (vyatireka: the correlative). This is presented not as theology but as observable fact. The word aparihārye arthe — 'in the matter of the unavoidable' — is the philosophical key. The Nyāya school teaches that grief is a mental state (mānasika duḥkha) which is justified only when grief might alter the outcome or when it honors a genuine loss. But when the outcome is absolutely fixed — dhruva — grief is both ineffective and irrational. It adds suffering without serving any purpose. Krishna's compassion here is not to deny the reality of birth and death but to question whether grief in their face is a sane response.","yogananda":"Yogananda meditates on the word dhruva — the fixed, the certain — and notes that this certainty, far from being a cause of despair, can be a source of profound peace. The yogi who truly knows that death is certain lives differently: not in dread, but in an urgency of love. Every moment becomes precious, not because it is scarce, but because it is real. And knowing that birth follows death — that the soul's journey continues — removes the weight of finality. Yogananda taught that the properly prepared meditator can actually experience the transition of death consciously — moving from one garment to another with full awareness, without the darkness of unconscious forgetting that ordinary death brings.","goyandka":"Goyandka emphasizes the phrase aparihārye arthe — 'in a matter that is unavoidable.' He notes that śāstra (scriptural wisdom) consistently teaches that grief is appropriate only when it can serve a purpose: when it motivates a person to remove the cause of suffering. But where the cause is aparihārya — absolutely unavoidable, by the very law of manifest existence — grief is simply suffering added to suffering, pain compounded without benefit. The wheel of birth and death (janna-maraṇa cakra) turns by the law of karma and māyā. Only jñāna (knowledge of the Atman) and ultimately liberation (mokṣa) can take one beyond this wheel — but that is a matter of living rightly and seeking wisdom, not of mourning."}},{"verse":28,"sanskrit":"अव्यक्तादीनि भूतानि व्यक्तमध्यानि भारत ।\\nअव्यक्तनिधनान्येव तत्र का परिदेवना ॥","transliteration":"avyaktādīni bhūtāni vyakta-madhyāni bhārata\\navyakta-nidhanāny eva tatra kā paridevanā","translation":"Beings are unmanifest in their beginning, manifest in the middle state, and again unmanifest at the end — what is there to lament, O Bharata?","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_28.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अव्यक्तादीनि","transliteration":"avyaktādīni","root":"avyakta (unmanifest) + ādi (beginning)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, nominative, neuter plural","meaning":"having the unmanifest as their beginning / unmanifest at the start"},{"word":"भूतानि","transliteration":"bhūtāni","root":"√bhū (to be/become) → bhūta","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, nominative plural","meaning":"beings / creatures / those that have come into existence"},{"word":"व्यक्तमध्यानि","transliteration":"vyakta-madhyāni","root":"vyakta (manifest) + madhya (middle)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, nominative, neuter plural","meaning":"having the manifest as their middle / perceivable in the middle period"},{"word":"निधनानि","transliteration":"nidhanāni","root":"ni + √dhā (to place) → nidhana (end, dissolution)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, nominative plural (here in compound)","meaning":"end / dissolution / death / cessation"},{"word":"परिदेवना","transliteration":"paridevanā","root":"pari + √div (to lament) → paridevanā","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"lamentation / wailing / mourning / grief"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse gave Dadaji immense peace during times of loss. Beings come from the unmanifest, live briefly in the visible world, and return to the unmanifest — like waves rising from the ocean, remaining briefly visible, and sinking back. The wave is not destroyed; the water has simply returned to the sea. Where then is there cause for paridevanā — that particular word for wailing grief, the most demonstrative and outward form of mourning? The manifest phase — this life — is the middle term, brief and precious. Before birth, the being was avyakta; after death, it returns to avyakta. Only the middle is visible to us, and because it is visible, we mistakenly think it is the whole story. Wisdom sees the full arc — and rests in peace.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda points out that this verse introduces a temporal argument to complement the metaphysical ones of the preceding verses. Here the focus is not on the nature of the Atman but on the nature of bhūtāni — all beings as experienced in time. The structure is a perfect triptych: unmanifest (avyakta) → manifest (vyakta) → unmanifest (avyakta). The manifest phase is sandwiched between two unmanifest phases. From the standpoint of Advaita, this reflects the cosmological cycle of creation: Brahman manifests as the universe (sṛṣṭi), sustains it (sthiti), and dissolves it back into itself (laya). Individual life mirrors the cosmic cycle. The question tatra kā paridevanā — 'what lamentation is fitting there?' — is not rhetorical dismissal of grief; it is a genuine inquiry into what reality justifies mourning.","yogananda":"Yogananda connects this verse to the mystery of consciousness between lives. In the avyakta state before birth and after death, the soul does not cease to exist — it rests in a subtle realm, reviewing the previous life, preparing for the next. Yogananda wrote extensively about this interlife state, drawing on both scriptural testimony and the reported experiences of advanced meditators. The manifest middle — this earthly life — is the school, the period of active learning and karma-making. But it is bracketed by the vast, quiet, unmanifest realm that is the soul's true home. Understanding this, the yogi does not cling to the middle period with desperate attachment, nor dread its ending.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that this verse presents what could be called the 'law of manifestation': all beings emerge from the avyakta (the unmanifest field of prakṛti or Brahman), take form in the manifest world for a time, and return to the avyakta. This is not a theological claim requiring faith — it is a description of the observable rhythm of all existence. Seeds lie hidden, sprout into plants, and return to earth. The question kā paridevanā — what is the occasion for lamentation? — invites the aspirant to examine whether grief, however natural it feels, is actually well-founded. When the return to the unmanifest is the natural completion of the cycle rather than a deviation from it, grief is revealed as arising from a limited perspective — the perspective of one who sees only the manifest middle."}},{"verse":29,"sanskrit":"आश्चर्यवत्पश्यति कश्चिदेन-\\nमाश्चर्यवद्वदति तथैव चान्यः ।\\nआश्चर्यवच्चैनमन्यः शृणोति\\nश्रुत्वाप्येनं वेद न चैव कश्चित् ॥","transliteration":"āścarya-vat paśyati kaścid enam\\nāścarya-vad vadati tathaiva cānyaḥ\\nāścarya-vac cainam anyaḥ śṛṇoti\\nśrutvāpy enaṃ veda na caiva kaścit","translation":"One sees this Self as a wonder; another speaks of it as a wonder; another hears of it as a wonder — yet even having heard, no one truly knows it.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_29.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"आश्चर्यवत्","transliteration":"āścarya-vat","root":"āścarya (wonder, marvel) + vat (suffix: like, in the manner of)","grammatical_form":"Adverb (formed from noun with -vat suffix)","meaning":"like a wonder / as something marvelous / with astonishment"},{"word":"पश्यति","transliteration":"paśyati","root":"√paś (to see / to perceive directly)","grammatical_form":"Verb, present, third person singular","meaning":"sees / directly perceives / beholds"},{"word":"कश्चित्","transliteration":"kaścit","root":"ka (who) + cit (enclitic particle)","grammatical_form":"Indefinite pronoun, nominative, masculine singular","meaning":"someone / a rare one / some rare person"},{"word":"शृणोति","transliteration":"śṛṇoti","root":"√śru (to hear / to listen)","grammatical_form":"Verb, present, third person singular","meaning":"hears / listens to / receives by hearing"},{"word":"वेद","transliteration":"veda","root":"√vid (to know, perfect tense used as present)","grammatical_form":"Verb, perfect used as present, third person singular","meaning":"knows / truly understands / has direct knowledge of"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji called this verse 'the verse of humility.' The Self is available to all — all can hear about it — but how few truly know it. The word kaścit (someone, some rare one) is repeated: a rare one sees it; another speaks of it as wonderful; another hears of it as wonderful. And yet, having heard, still no one truly knows it. This is not a cause for despair but for wonder — āścarya. The Self is inexhaustible as an object of wonder. You can study it for a lifetime, have glimpses of it in meditation, hear the most luminous teachers describe it — and still it exceeds your grasp. Because to 'know' it in the ordinary sense is impossible: the knower and the known would have to be separate, but the Self is the very knower itself. This is its greatest wonder.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that this verse echoes almost verbatim the famous passage from the Kaṭha Upaniṣad (1.2.7): āścaryo 'sya vaktā kuśalo 'sya labdhā āścaryo 'sya jñātā kuśalānuśiṣṭaḥ — 'Wonderful is the one who teaches it; rare is the one who attains it; wonderful is the knower, taught by a capable teacher.' The Gītā here draws on Upaniṣadic authority explicitly. The three modes — seeing (paśyati), speaking (vadati), hearing (śṛṇoti) — correspond to the three paths of transmission: direct perception (darśana), verbal teaching (upadeśa), and listening (śravaṇa). Yet all three fall short of veda — direct, transformative knowing. This is because the Atman cannot be objectified: it is the eternal subject, the witness of all seeing, speaking, and hearing.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees āścarya (wonder) as the appropriate and permanent relationship of the mind to the Self. The mind that ceases to wonder at the Self has, in some sense, reduced it to a concept — which is always a lesser thing than the reality. The great yogis and saints retain this sense of wonder throughout their lives, even after decades of deep realization. To see it is wonderful; to speak of it is wonderful; to hear of it is wonderful. And yet — śrutvāpy enaṃ veda na caiva kaścit — having heard, no one truly knows it. This is not pessimism; it is an invitation to move beyond hearing into being. The wonder is not an obstacle — it is the door. Approach in wonder, enter in silence, and discover what no words can contain.","goyandka":"Goyandka cites this verse's close parallel in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad and emphasizes that the three modes of engagement — seeing, speaking, hearing — represent the three stages of traditional Vedantic study: darśana (intuitive vision), upadeśa (teaching), and śravaṇa (listening). All three are precious, all three are rare, and all three are insufficient by themselves to produce veda — the living knowledge. Goyandka stresses that veda here does not mean intellectual comprehension but aparokṣa anubhūti — direct, immediate, experiential realization. This is why the last phrase — na caiva kaścit — is not a counsel of despair but a pointer toward the means of knowledge that lies beyond the ordinary: nididhyāsana (sustained meditation on the teachings) that matures into direct realization."}},{"verse":30,"sanskrit":"देही नित्यमवध्योऽयं देहे सर्वस्य भारत ।\\nतस्मात्सर्वाणि भूतानि न त्वं शोचितुमर्हसि ॥","transliteration":"dehī nityam avadhyo 'yaṃ dehe sarvasya bhārata\\ntasmāt sarvāṇi bhūtāni na tvaṃ śocitum arhasi","translation":"The embodied Self in the body of everyone is ever indestructible.

The teaching began with Arjuna weeping for specific people: Bhīṣma, Droṇa, his sons, his kinsmen. And now it ends with the most universal statement possible: the dehī — the Self — is avadhya (beyond all killing), nityam (always, without exception), in dehe sarvasya — in the body of every single being. Therefore — ta smāt — you should not grieve for any being. Not these warriors. Not any person. Not any creature. The circle of compassion has become so wide that it encompasses all of existence — and within this infinite compassion is the recognition that all are the same indestructible Self. Dadaji would fold his hands and bow after reciting this verse, as if to the whole of creation.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda notes the beautiful structural completion of this section. Verse 11 began: 'The wise do not grieve for the living or the dead.' Now, having built the entire philosophical case through nineteen verses, the teaching closes with: 'Therefore you should not grieve for any being.' The progression is from declaration to demonstration to conclusion. The universalization in this verse is important: na tvaṃ śocitum arhasi is now extended from specific individuals (Bhīṣma, Droṇa) to sarvāṇi bhūtāni — all beings. The Self in every body, in every being — from the smallest creature to the greatest sage — is the same avadhya (indestructible) reality. Grief for any of them, at the level of ultimate truth, is grief based on mistaken identity.","yogananda":"For Yogananda, this verse is the foundation of universal love. The Self — the same Self — dwells in every body (dehe sarvasya). To know this is to love all beings not sentimentally but truly, because you recognize in every face the face of the Beloved. This knowledge, Yogananda taught, does not make one cold to suffering — quite the opposite. It makes one a servant of all, because the all is seen as the One wearing many costumes. And it makes grief — in the ordinary, ego-based sense of 'I have lost mine' — impossible, because there is no 'mine' separate from the All. The sage who has realized this moves through the world in a state of continuous wonder and love, unshaken by the comings and goings of forms.","goyandka":"Goyandka emphasizes that this verse concludes the 'Ātma-bodha' (Self-knowledge) section of the Gītā's second chapter with a practical injunction: na tvaṃ śocitum arhasi — 'you ought not to grieve.' The word arhasi (you ought, you deserve, it is fitting for you) carries a note of moral expectation: one who has received this teaching is now obligated, as a matter of spiritual integrity, to live in accordance with it. The universalization — sarvāṇi bhūtāni (all beings) — ensures that the teaching cannot be applied selectively. The Atman is avadhya everywhere, in every deha, at all times (nityam). Grief for any being is therefore a failure of comprehension — not a moral failure, but a cognitive one that knowledge alone can correct."}},{"verse":31,"sanskrit":"स्वधर्ममपि चावेक्ष्य न विकम्पितुमर्हसि ।\\nधर्म्याद्धि युद्धाच्छ्रेयोऽन्यत्क्षत्रियस्य न विद्यते ॥","transliteration":"sva-dharmam api cāvekṣya na vikampitum arhasi\\ndharmyād dhi yuddhāc chreyo 'nyat kṣatriyasya na vidyate","translation":"Looking even at your own dharma, you should not waver — for a kshatriya, there is nothing greater than a righteous war.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_31.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"स्वधर्मम्","transliteration":"sva-dharmam","root":"sva (own) + dharma (duty/law)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, accusative, masculine singular","meaning":"one's own duty / one's inherent dharma"},{"word":"अवेक्ष्य","transliteration":"avekṣya","root":"ava + √īkṣ (to see/consider)","grammatical_form":"Gerund (absolutive)","meaning":"having considered / looking at / upon reflection"},{"word":"विकम्पितुम्","transliteration":"vikampitum","root":"vi + √kamp (to tremble/waver)","grammatical_form":"Infinitive","meaning":"to waver / to tremble / to falter"},{"word":"धर्म्यात्","transliteration":"dharmyāt","root":"dharma + ya (adjectival suffix)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, ablative, masculine singular","meaning":"from a righteous (one) / from that which is lawful"},{"word":"क्षत्रियस्य","transliteration":"kṣatriyasya","root":"kṣatra (rulership/protection)","grammatical_form":"Noun, genitive, masculine singular","meaning":"of the kshatriya / belonging to the warrior class"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji would say that this verse is Krishna's gentle but firm hand on Arjuna's shoulder. 'Look at who you are, child — not who you are afraid to be.' The word sva-dharma carries immense weight. It is not merely social duty but one's soul-nature, the dharma written into the very texture of one's being. A warrior who flees righteousness betrays not just a social role but his own inner constitution. Dadaji would remind us that God never asks us to perform someone else's dharma — only our own, however difficult. The greatness of this verse is that it does not argue from scripture alone but from the evidence of Arjuna's own nature. Look within, Krishna says. You already know what you must do.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda points out that Krishna here shifts strategy. Having argued from the eternal nature of the Atman in the Sankhya section, he now argues from the relative plane of dharma — the level at which Arjuna actually stands. This is the mark of a great teacher: meeting the student where he is. Sva-dharma is one's specific station in the cosmic order. For a kshatriya, whose very purpose is the protection of righteousness through force when necessary, a righteous war is the highest fulfillment of dharma. The word vikampitum (to waver) is carefully chosen — wavering here is not humility but a failure of discernment, an inability to see one's own true duty clearly.","yogananda":"Yogananda reads sva-dharma as the soul's unique assignment in this incarnation — the work it has come to do. He writes that when a soul refuses its God-given assignment out of personal sentiment, it delays its own evolution. The warrior nature in Arjuna is not an accident of birth but a divine endowment. To deny it is to deny the instrument God has fashioned. Yogananda also sees the inner parallel: within us, the forces of light (the kshatriya-will) must engage the forces of darkness (tamas, delusion, fear) in righteous inner battle. Shrinking from this inner war is what keeps the soul in bondage across many lifetimes.","goyandka":"Goyandka emphasizes that this verse introduces the crucial concept of sva-dharma, which will recur throughout the Gita (cf. 3.35, 18.47). The dharmyāt yuddhāt — the righteous battle — is not mere physical combat but an engagement that upholds the moral and social order of the world. Kṣatriyasya na vidyate — 'for the kshatriya, there is nothing superior' — is an unambiguous declaration of hierarchical dharma. Each varṇa has its svadharma, and the highest fulfillment of the kshatriya's dharma is precisely this: to fight for righteousness when righteousness is at stake. Abandoning this duty in the name of compassion is, as subsequent verses make clear, a path leading to shame and adharma."}},{"verse":32,"sanskrit":"यदृच्छया चोपपन्नं स्वर्गद्वारमपावृतम् ।\\nसुखिनः क्षत्रियाः पार्थ लभन्ते युद्धमीदृशम् ॥","transliteration":"yadṛcchayā copapannaṃ svarga-dvāram apāvṛtam\\nsukhinaḥ kṣatriyāḥ pārtha labhante yuddham īdṛśam","translation":"Happy indeed are those kshatriyas, O Partha, who obtain such a battle — coming of its own accord as an open gateway to heaven.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_32.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यदृच्छया","transliteration":"yadṛcchayā","root":"yad (which) + icchā (desire/will) → yadṛcchā (spontaneous occurrence)","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, instrumental singular","meaning":"by chance / of its own accord / unsought"},{"word":"स्वर्गद्वारम्","transliteration":"svarga-dvāram","root":"svarga (heaven) + dvāra (gate/door)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, accusative, neuter singular","meaning":"the gateway to heaven"},{"word":"अपावृतम्","transliteration":"apāvṛtam","root":"apa + ā + √vṛ (to cover) → apāvṛta (uncovered/opened)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, accusative, neuter singular","meaning":"opened / thrown open / unobstructed"},{"word":"सुखिनः","transliteration":"sukhinaḥ","root":"sukha (pleasure/happiness)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, nominative, masculine plural","meaning":"fortunate ones / happy / blessed"},{"word":"लभन्ते","transliteration":"labhante","root":"√labh (to obtain/receive)","grammatical_form":"Verb, present, third person plural, ātmanepada","meaning":"they obtain / they receive / they gain"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji loved this verse for its sheer joy. He would say: 'When God sends you exactly the difficulty your soul needs, should you weep or rejoice?' The righteous battle comes yadṛcchayā — unsought, unbidden, appearing as if by grace. This is not luck; this is the divine arrangement for one's growth. The gate of heaven stands open — not as a literal celestial reward, but as the doorway to a higher state of being that opens when we face our dharmic trials with courage and surrender. Arjuna is being told: this battle came to you because you are ready for it. The highest battles are always gifts, even when they appear as burdens.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda notes the profound irony Krishna introduces here. The entire Gita began because Arjuna placed his weapons down, refusing the battle. Yet Krishna says: fortunate are those to whom such battles come unsought! The word yadṛcchayā — coming by itself, spontaneously — signals that this dharmic challenge has arrived through the working of karma and the divine will, not through Arjuna's contrivance. The image of svarga-dvāram apāvṛtam — the open gateway to heaven — captures the highest Vedic aspiration of the warrior class. But from the Advaita standpoint, 'heaven' ultimately points to the liberation that comes from perfectly fulfilled duty, which purifies the mind for knowledge of the Self.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees svarga-dvāram apāvṛtam as pointing to the opened states of higher consciousness that heroic spiritual effort makes accessible. When we engage our dharmic battle — inner or outer — with full courage and without shrinking, the doors of divine experience swing open. The word yadṛcchayā tells us that such opportunities are not manufactured by personal ambition but arrive by God's own timing. 'Happy are those kshatriyas' — happy are those souls — to whom God presents the supreme test, for it is the supreme invitation. The test is always perfectly calibrated to the soul's readiness.","goyandka":"Goyandka observes that this verse provides a powerful positive motivation to complement the preceding verse's appeal to duty. Not only is it Arjuna's dharma to fight — it is his extraordinary fortune. The battle at Kurukshetra has come yadṛcchayā, unsolicited, because it is the fruit of accumulated karma and divine dispensation. For a kshatriya to die in righteous battle was held, in the Vedic tradition, to guarantee a blessed afterlife — svarga. The verse thus addresses both the dharmic and the eschatological dimensions of Arjuna's hesitation. One who understands this dual truth — duty fulfilled and heaven secured — has no reason to waver."}},{"verse":33,"sanskrit":"अथ चेत्त्वमिमं धर्म्यं सङ्ग्रामं न करिष्यसि ।\\nततः स्वधर्मं कीर्तिं च हित्वा पापमवाप्स्यसि ॥","transliteration":"atha cet tvam imaṃ dharmyaṃ saṃgrāmaṃ na kariṣyasi\\ntataḥ sva-dharmaṃ kīrtiṃ ca hitvā pāpam avāpsyasi","translation":"But if you do not engage in this righteous battle, forsaking your own duty and honor, you shall incur sin.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_33.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"धर्म्यम्","transliteration":"dharmyam","root":"dharma + ya (adjectival suffix)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, accusative, masculine singular","meaning":"righteous / lawful / in accordance with dharma"},{"word":"सङ्ग्रामम्","transliteration":"saṃgrāmam","root":"sam + √gram / grāma (assembly for battle)","grammatical_form":"Noun, accusative, masculine singular","meaning":"battle / war / contest"},{"word":"कीर्तिम्","transliteration":"kīrtim","root":"√kīrt (to praise/celebrate)","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, accusative singular","meaning":"honor / glory / good reputation"},{"word":"हित्वा","transliteration":"hitvā","root":"√hā (to abandon/forsake)","grammatical_form":"Gerund (absolutive)","meaning":"having abandoned / forsaking / giving up"},{"word":"पापम्","transliteration":"pāpam","root":"√pāp / pāpa (evil, sin)","grammatical_form":"Noun, accusative, neuter singular","meaning":"sin / evil / demerit"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji would say that this verse is the shadow that gives shape to the preceding light. Krishna shows both doors: the path of duty leads to heaven; the path of abandonment leads to pāpa. But dadaji would gently note that this pāpa is not primarily a punishment from outside — it is the inner suffering that follows self-betrayal. When we abandon what we know to be right, something in the soul is wounded. Kīrti — honor — is also a kind of inner wholeness, a harmony between outer action and inner truth. To hitvā kīrtim, to abandon that harmony, is to lose something more precious than a reputation. It is to fracture the integrity of the self.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that Krishna now applies the logic from both directions. The previous verse held out the promise of righteous battle as heaven's gate; this verse shows what lies on the other side — pāpam, sin. The word hitvā — having forsaken — applies to both sva-dharmaṃ and kīrtim together. This is important: it is not merely that Arjuna will be dishonored by others; he will have internally abandoned his own dharma, which is the real source of the sin. In Vedanta, pāpa is not merely a social stigma but an impurity of the inner instrument (antaḥkaraṇa) that veils the Self. Adharma creates psychological and spiritual turbulence regardless of whether anyone else knows.","yogananda":"Yogananda interprets pāpa here as the karmic weight of refusing a God-given mission. When the soul is positioned by karma and divine will to perform a specific task for dharma's sake, to refuse it out of misguided sentiment is to create a karmic debt that must be discharged in future births. The abandonment of kīrti — inner spiritual glory, not mere reputation — is also significant. The warrior's soul carries the vibration of valor as its natural dignity. To betray that is to dim the soul's own light. Yogananda reminds us that God designs each soul's dharmic challenges precisely; refusing them is not humility — it is evasion.","goyandka":"Goyandka reads this verse as the negative complement to verse 31. The logical structure is: if you fulfill your sva-dharma, you gain the highest fruit (verse 32); if you abandon it, you lose both dharma and kīrti and gain only pāpa (verse 33). The pairing makes Krishna's argument dialectically complete. Goyandka notes that pāpam avāpsyasi — 'you will incur sin' — uses the future tense, indicating a certainty, not a mere possibility. The abandonment of righteous duty is not a neutral act; it sets in motion a chain of karmic consequences. Kīrti for a kshatriya is not mere vanity but the social dharma of being an upholder and exemplar of righteousness."}},{"verse":34,"sanskrit":"अकीर्तिं चापि भूतानि कथयिष्यन्ति तेऽव्ययाम् ।\\nसम्भावितस्य चाकीर्तिर्मरणादतिरिच्यते ॥","transliteration":"akīrtiṃ cāpi bhūtāni kathayiṣyanti te 'vyayām\\nsambhāvitasya cākīrtir maraṇād atiricyate","translation":"Beings will forever speak of your infamy — and for one who has been honored, infamy is worse than death.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_34.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अकीर्तिम्","transliteration":"akīrtim","root":"a (negation) + kīrti (glory/honor)","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, accusative singular","meaning":"infamy / dishonor / ill-repute"},{"word":"अव्ययाम्","transliteration":"avyayām","root":"a + vi + √i (to go) → avyaya (undecaying)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, accusative, feminine singular","meaning":"imperishable / everlasting / undying"},{"word":"सम्भावितस्य","transliteration":"sambhāvitasya","root":"sam + √bhū (to become) → sambhāvita (honored/esteemed)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, genitive, masculine singular","meaning":"of the honored one / of the highly esteemed"},{"word":"अकीर्तिः","transliteration":"akīrtiḥ","root":"a + kīrti","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"infamy / disgrace / dishonor"},{"word":"अतिरिच्यते","transliteration":"atiricyate","root":"ati + √ric (to exceed/surpass)","grammatical_form":"Verb, passive, present, third person singular","meaning":"exceeds / surpasses / is worse than"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji taught that Krishna is not appealing to ego here — he is speaking to the deepest nature of a noble soul. Sambhāvitasya — the one who has been held in high esteem — carries a sacred responsibility. When the world trusts your dharmic integrity, your inner life becomes entangled with that trust. To shatter it through cowardice is to create a wound in the social fabric of dharma itself. Akīrti avyayā — imperishable infamy — is a striking irony. Earlier Krishna said the Atman is avyaya, imperishable. Now infamy too will be avyaya if Arjuna flees. The deathless can manifest as either liberation or as shame — depending on which path we choose.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda finds this verse brilliantly constructed. The word avyayām — eternal, imperishable — was used earlier to describe the immortal Atman. Here it describes infamy. The irony is pointed: Arjuna was concerned about causing the death of bodies, which are by nature perishable. But the akīrti that will arise from his cowardice will be avyayā — lasting far beyond those perishable bodies. Furthermore, sambhāvitasya — of one who is honored — is key. For a person whose life has established a high dharmic standard, a single failure of that standard reverberates immeasurably. Reputation is a form of social dharma; for great souls, the collapse of that dharmic standing is a spiritual catastrophe.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees this verse as speaking to the soul's own inner memory across lifetimes. The akīrti that will be spoken of is not only what others say — it is the soul's own inner record of having turned away from its highest calling. The truly honored soul — sambhāvita — is one whose spiritual development has reached a high station. The deeper meaning of 'infamy worse than death' is that the soul that betrays its dharma carries that wound forward, because the soul does not die. For the awakened being, the sting of spiritual failure is far more painful than any physical death. Yogananda encourages us to read this verse not as social pressure but as the inner voice of the soul's own integrity.","goyandka":"Goyandka carefully distinguishes the two dimensions of this verse: the social (bhūtāni kathayiṣyanti — people will speak) and the personal (sambhāvitasya akīrtiḥ). For a great warrior like Arjuna — whose glory has been established through years of valor and righteousness — the collapse of that reputation would be a lifelong wound. Goyandka cites the traditional kshatriya ethic: to die in battle is honorable; to flee is the deepest disgrace. This is not mere social convention but a reflection of the eternal law that each being is obligated to discharge its nature fully. The shame of a betrayed dharma endures; the pain of righteous death passes."}},{"verse":35,"sanskrit":"भयाद्रणादुपरतं मंस्यन्ते त्वां महारथाः ।\\nयेषां च त्वं बहुमतो भूत्वा यास्यसि लाघवम् ॥","transliteration":"bhayād raṇād uparataṃ maṃsyante tvāṃ mahā-rathāḥ\\nyeṣāṃ ca tvaṃ bahu-mato bhūtvā yāsyasi lāghavam","translation":"The great chariot-warriors will think you have withdrawn from battle out of fear — and those who held you in high esteem will come to think little of you.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_35.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"भयात्","transliteration":"bhayāt","root":"√bhī (to fear)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, ablative singular","meaning":"out of fear / from fear"},{"word":"महारथाः","transliteration":"mahā-rathāḥ","root":"mahā (great) + ratha (chariot)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"great chariot-warriors / supreme commanders"},{"word":"बहुमतः","transliteration":"bahu-mataḥ","root":"bahu (many/much) + mata (regarded/esteemed)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, nominative, masculine singular","meaning":"highly regarded / greatly esteemed / held in high honor"},{"word":"लाघवम्","transliteration":"lāghavam","root":"laghu (light/trivial) → lāghava (lightness/insignificance)","grammatical_form":"Noun, accusative, neuter singular","meaning":"insignificance / disrespect / being thought little of"},{"word":"उपरतम्","transliteration":"uparatam","root":"upa + √ram (to cease/stop)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, accusative, masculine singular","meaning":"withdrawn / having ceased / retired from"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji saw this verse as Krishna's compassionate use of a real human vulnerability — the fear of being misunderstood. Arjuna has spent his life building a reputation for absolute courage. Now the mahā-rathāḥ — the great warriors on both sides who have seen him in action — will conclude only one thing: he fled from fear. Dadaji would say: 'The irony is complete. Arjuna's inner war is about compassion. But the outer world can only see behavior — and behavior that looks like retreat will always be judged as cowardice.' The teaching is not to live for approval, but to live in such a way that one's dharmic integrity is unmistakable. Lāghavam — being thought light, trivial — is a painful fall from the heights of bahu-mataḥ, being greatly honored.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda observes that this verse introduces the concept of social dharma and its consequences. The mahā-rathāḥ are not merely witnesses — they are the community of dharmic warriors who uphold the order of righteousness through mutual trust and standards. When one of their greatest members breaks ranks without explanation, the damage spreads. Lāghavam — lightness, triviality — is the opposite of the gravity and weight that a great warrior like Arjuna is supposed to carry. From the Vedantic perspective, this social consequence is also a reflection of the inner lāghavam — a spiritual lightness that arises when the soul fails to carry its full dharmic weight.","yogananda":"Yogananda notes that this verse speaks to the soul's relationship with its own community of fellow-travelers. The mahā-rathāḥ represent those who have walked the path of heroic effort; they recognize and honor each other's courage. To withdraw in apparent fear is to sever that bond of mutual recognition. In the inner life, when the will weakens before the forces of delusion, the higher faculties of the mind — which Yogananda sees as the inner mahā-rathāḥ — withdraw their trust. The soul that turns from its dharmic struggle loses the inner support of its own higher nature. Bahu-mataḥ becomes lāghavam — inner self-respect collapses into a subtle self-contempt.","goyandka":"Goyandka points out that this verse is carefully constructed: it addresses both the external judgment (mahā-rathāḥ will think you fled from fear) and the social consequence (those who honored you will come to disrespect you). Bhayād raṇād uparataṃ — withdrawn from battle through fear — is the most damning possible interpretation of Arjuna's action, and it is the interpretation that will naturally arise. Goyandka notes that in the kshatriya code, the only legitimate reason to withdraw from a righteous battle is the command of one's guru or king — neither of which applies here. Arjuna's withdrawal is therefore completely inexplicable within the dharmic framework of his station."}},{"verse":36,"sanskrit":"अवाच्यवादांश्च बहून्वदिष्यन्ति तवाहिताः ।\\nनिन्दन्तस्तव सामर्थ्यं ततो दुःखतरं नु किम् ॥","transliteration":"avācya-vādāṃś ca bahūn vadiṣyanti tavāhitāḥ\\nnindantas tava sāmarthyaṃ tato duḥkhataraṃ nu kim","translation":"Your enemies will speak many unspeakable words, deriding your strength — what could be more painful than this?","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_36.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अवाच्यवादान्","transliteration":"avācya-vādān","root":"a + √vac (to speak) → avācya (unspeakable) + vāda (speech/words)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, accusative, masculine plural","meaning":"unspeakable words / words that should not be said / harsh abuse"},{"word":"अहिताः","transliteration":"ahitāḥ","root":"a + hita (beneficial/friendly) → ahita (enemy/harmful)","grammatical_form":"Adjective used as noun, nominative, masculine plural","meaning":"enemies / those who wish ill / adversaries"},{"word":"निन्दन्तः","transliteration":"nindantaḥ","root":"√nind (to censure/revile)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, nominative, masculine plural","meaning":"deriding / censuring / mocking / blaming"},{"word":"सामर्थ्यम्","transliteration":"sāmarthyam","root":"sa + artha + ya → sāmarthya (capability/power)","grammatical_form":"Noun, accusative, neuter singular","meaning":"strength / capability / prowess / power"},{"word":"दुःखतरम्","transliteration":"duḥkhataram","root":"duḥkha (pain/sorrow) + tara (comparative suffix)","grammatical_form":"Comparative adjective, accusative, neuter singular","meaning":"more painful / worse suffering / greater sorrow"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji appreciated how Krishna completes the picture of social consequence in this verse. It is not only the esteem of allies that will be lost — the enemies will actively compound the wound. Avācya-vādān — unspeakable words — is a powerful phrase. These are insults that a noble soul should never have to hear directed at them; words that dishonor both the speaker and the one spoken of. Nindantas tava sāmarthyam — mocking your very strength — is the most cutting kind of insult, for it attacks what Arjuna has devoted his life to cultivating. Dadaji would say: 'When we betray our dharma, we hand our enemies the very weapons with which to wound us. Nothing is more painful than a self-inflicted dishonor.'","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda sees in this verse a masterful psychological appeal to the kshatriya's code. The avācya-vādāḥ — words that ought not to be spoken — are especially degrading precisely because they are directed at sāmarthyam, the warrior's fundamental power and competence. This is not mere social embarrassment; it is an attack on the identity that has been painstakingly built through years of righteous effort. The rhetorical question at the end — tato duḥkhataraṃ nu kim, 'what could be more painful than this?' — is unanswerable. Krishna has systematically escalated the consequences of inaction: loss of dharma, loss of honor, military misjudgment, and now the active humiliation by enemies.","yogananda":"Yogananda frames this verse in terms of the inner enemies — the forces of ignorance, delusion, and ego — that mock the soul whenever it fails its dharmic test. The avācya-vādāḥ spoken by ahitāḥ (enemies) are paralleled inwardly by the relentless whispers of self-doubt and regret that torment a soul that has retreated from its calling. Sāmarthyam — one's God-given strength — when denied and mocked is indeed the deepest wound. Yogananda teaches that God endows each soul with specific gifts precisely so they may be used in His service; when those gifts are abandoned, the soul experiences a profound spiritual duḥkha that no outer comfort can heal.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that this verse completes the social argument. The consequences of abandoning the righteous battle now span all relationships: allies will assume cowardice (v.35), and enemies will compound the wound with open mockery. The word bahūn — many words — suggests the flood of derision that will follow. Goyandka notes that avācya-vādāḥ — unspeakable words — refers specifically to insults that attack one's lineage, ancestry, and fundamental character, which in the Vedic tradition are the gravest possible social injuries. The rhetorical question concluding the verse — tato duḥkhataraṃ nu kim — serves as a climax to Krishna's argument from social and personal consequence."}},{"verse":37,"sanskrit":"हतो वा प्राप्स्यसि स्वर्गं जित्वा वा भोक्ष्यसे महीम् ।\\nतस्मादुत्तिष्ठ कौन्तेय युद्धाय कृतनिश्चयः ॥","transliteration":"hato vā prāpsyasi svargaṃ jitvā vā bhokṣyase mahīm\\ntasmād uttiṣṭha kaunteya yuddhāya kṛta-niścayaḥ","translation":"Slain, you will attain heaven; victorious, you will enjoy the earth.

If you fall in battle, you gain svarga — the higher state of being that awaits those who gave their all in righteousness. If you win, you enjoy mahī — the earth and its fruits. There is no losing outcome when one acts in dharma. This is the logic of surrender to God's will: when we fully commit to our God-given duty, the result is always in God's hands, and God's hands hold only grace. Uttiṣṭha — arise! — is one of the great imperatives of the Gita. Dadaji would say it is spoken to every soul that sits paralyzed by doubt: Arise. Act. God will take care of the rest.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that this verse presents what Vedanta calls the two-horned dilemma (ubhaya-pakṣa) — whichever way it goes, Arjuna gains. From the higher Vedantic perspective, this verse belongs to the vyāvahārika (conventional) level of teaching: it uses the language of svarga and mahī — heaven and earth — as motivations within the relative framework. Later, in verse 38, Krishna will transcend this framework entirely with the teaching of sama (equanimity). But for now, even on the relative plane, righteousness is a complete win. Kṛta-niścayaḥ — with firm resolution — is the disposition of the yogi: once discernment (viveka) determines the right course, the will must follow without further hesitation.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees in uttiṣṭha — arise — one of the most spiritually charged commands of the Gita. He writes that this word is addressed not to a warrior on a battlefield but to the immortal soul in every human being. Svarga for Yogananda represents the higher states of consciousness that open to the soul when it acts from dharma and courage. Mahīm — enjoyment of the earth — represents the outer fulfillment that follows inner alignment. Kṛta-niścayaḥ — firm resolve — is the quality of the spiritually mature person who has moved through doubt into clarity. Yogananda teaches that this decisive quality is itself a spiritual attainment, born of meditation and self-knowledge.","goyandka":"Goyandka presents this as the concluding verse of the dharma-based argument. All the preceding reasoning — about svadharma, about kīrti and akīrti, about what the great warriors will think — culminates in this simple, luminous formulation: both outcomes of righteous action are auspicious. Hato vā — slain — prāpsyasi svargam: the warrior who falls in righteous battle attains the highest heavenly realm. Jitvā vā — victorious — bhokṣyase mahīm: the warrior who wins enjoys sovereign dominion over the earth. The command uttiṣṭha — arise — delivered to Arjuna as Kaunteya (son of Kuntī) invokes his noble maternal lineage, reinforcing the call to ancestral duty and dynastic honor."}},{"verse":38,"sanskrit":"सुखदुःखे समे कृत्वा लाभालाभौ जयाजयौ ।\\nततो युद्धाय युज्यस्व नैवं पापमवाप्स्यसि ॥","transliteration":"sukha-duḥkhe same kṛtvā lābhālābhau jayājayau\\ntato yuddhāya yujyasva naivaṃ pāpam avāpsyasi","translation":"Treating pleasure and pain alike, gain and loss alike, victory and defeat alike — engage in battle!

Everything before this was argument — necessary, skillful argument. But this verse plants the seed of yoga. Sukha-duḥkhe same — treating pleasure and pain as equal — is not indifference. It is a vast inner spaciousness that refuses to be owned by either experience. Dadaji taught this through his own life: he had known great joy and great loss, and he met both with the same quiet smile. 'Naivaṃ pāpam avāpsyasi' — thus you will incur no sin — points to something profound: sin (pāpa) is rooted in craving and aversion. Eliminate those, and action becomes clean, pure, sin-free. This is the Gita's great gift.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda identifies this as a pivotal verse marking the transition from the dharma argument to the early statement of Karma Yoga. The three pairs — sukha-duḥkha, lābhālābha, jayājaya — represent the complete spectrum of outcome that any action can produce. Same kṛtvā — having made them equal — is the inner stance of the karma yogi. This is not nihilistic indifference (tamas) but the active equanimity of a fully engaged, fully detached soul (sattva). Yuddha here is no longer merely the Kurukshetra battle — it becomes a symbol for all purposeful action in the world. Naivaṃ pāpam — no sin thus — because sin is attachment and reaction; equanimity dissolves the very ground from which sin grows.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees in this verse the Gita's first direct formulation of the law of even-mindedness (samatā), which he considers the master key of the spiritual life. The three pairs — pleasure/pain, gain/loss, victory/defeat — correspond to the three fundamental oscillations of the uncontrolled mind. The yogi who has stilled these oscillations through meditation and practice of non-attachment acts in the world without being bound by it. Yogananda teaches that this equanimity is not achieved through suppression but through the expansion of consciousness to a state where the pairs of opposites are held within a larger, untroubled awareness. Yuddha — battle — becomes a metaphor for engaged spiritual living.","goyandka":"Goyandka regards this verse as the hinge-point of the second chapter — the final verse of the kshatriya-dharma argument and the first seed of the Karma Yoga teaching. The three dvandvas (pairs of opposites) enumerated here — pleasure-pain, gain-loss, victory-defeat — are the standard Vedantic formulation of the relativities that bind the ordinary person to karmic reaction. Same kṛtvā — making them equal — is the definition of nishkāma karma, action without desire. Goyandka notes that naivaṃ pāpam avāpsyasi — 'you will not incur sin thus' — is a sweeping statement: the yogi of equanimity is completely free from karmic bondage. This is the first glimpse of mokṣa held out through the path of action."}},{"verse":39,"sanskrit":"एषा तेऽभिहिता साङ्ख्ये बुद्धिर्योगे त्विमां शृणु ।\\nबुद्ध्या युक्तो यया पार्थ कर्मबन्धं प्रहास्यसि ॥","transliteration":"eṣā te 'bhihitā sāṃkhye buddhir yoge tv imāṃ śṛṇu\\nbuddhyā yukto yayā pārtha karma-bandhaṃ prahāsyasi","translation":"This intelligence has been declared to you in Sankhya.

Dadaji would say that verse 39 is the door between two rooms of the same divine house — the room of Jñāna (Sankhya wisdom) and the room of Karma Yoga. Eṣā te abhihitā — 'this has been declared to you' — is a completion signal. The Atman-teaching is done. Now comes the application. The Buddha-like serenity of Sankhya must translate into the active discipline of Yoga. Karma-bandhaṃ prahāsyasi — 'you shall completely shed the bondage of karma' — is a promise, not merely a hope. Dadaji would remind his students: 'God never gives you knowledge without giving you the path to use it. First the understanding; then the practice; then the freedom.'","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda marks this as one of the most structurally important verses of the Gita. It is the explicit transition statement between Sāṃkhya Yoga (the path of knowledge, taught in the preceding verses) and Karma Yoga (the path of action, to be expounded from here). Buddhiḥ — the discriminative intelligence — is the thread that connects both. In Sankhya, this buddhi knows the nature of the eternal Self; in Yoga, this same buddhi guides action in the world without creating karmic bondage. Karma-bandham prahāsyasi — 'you shall completely shed the karma-bondage' — is a future tense promise contingent on yuktatā, being properly equipped with this wisdom-guided action.","yogananda":"Yogananda celebrates this verse as the announcement of the great practical path. The Sankhya teaching established who you truly are: the immortal, indestructible Self. Now the Yoga teaching will show how to live from that identity in the midst of active life. Buddhyā yukto — equipped with wisdom — is the defining characteristic of the karma yogi: one who acts with the full light of discriminative intelligence guiding every move. Karma-bandham prahāsyasi — shedding karma-bondage — is what Yogananda calls the liberation of action: when consciousness is centered in the Self, actions flow without creating new chains. This is the Gita's unique gift: freedom not from the world, but freedom within it.","goyandka":"Goyandka provides a precise commentary on the structural function of this verse. Sāṃkhye refers to the body of teaching from verse 11 through verse 38 — the nature of the Ātman, its immortality, the duties of the kshatriya, the doctrine of equanimity. Yoge refers to what begins from verse 40 onward — the detailed exposition of Karma Yoga. The bridge is buddhiḥ — the same intelligence that was instructed in Sankhya must now be applied as the governing principle of action. Prahāsyasi — 'you shall completely cast off' — uses the prefix pra (completely, thoroughly), indicating not partial but total liberation from karma-bondha. This is the Gita's central promise to the sincere seeker."}},{"verse":40,"sanskrit":"नेहाभिक्रमनाशोऽस्ति प्रत्यवायो न विद्यते ।\\nस्वल्पमप्यस्य धर्मस्य त्रायते महतो भयात् ॥","transliteration":"nehābhikrama-nāśo 'sti pratyavāyo na vidyate\\nsv-alpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt","translation":"In this path, no effort is ever lost, nor is there any adverse result.

He would repeat it slowly, then smile and say: 'Do you understand? Not one step on this path is wasted. Not one.' Nehābhikrama-nāśo 'sti — there is no destruction of what you begin here. In ordinary worldly effort, incompletion means loss. But in the yoga of inner growth, every sincere step forward is permanently inscribed in the soul. Even if you live for a year and practice yoga for only one month, those fruits remain — carried forward into the next life. Sv-alpam api — even a little — trāyate mahato bhayāt — protects from great fear. Great fear means the terror of repeated birth and death, the terror of not knowing who you are. Even a small taste of this wisdom dissolves it.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda identifies this verse as one of the most encouraging in all of scripture. The two guarantees Krishna offers are: (1) no abhikrama-nāśa — no loss of spiritual effort already made — and (2) no pratyavāya — no adverse karmic consequence from this path (unlike rituals, which if incompletely performed can produce negative results). This is a powerful contrast with the ritualistic karma-kāṇḍa of the Vedas, where partial performance of sacrifices could be harmful. Karma Yoga, being free from desire, cannot produce harmful karma. And mahato bhayāt — great fear — refers ultimately to saṃsāra, the cycle of rebirth driven by ignorance. Even a tiny step toward the light of self-knowledge offers real protection against this.","yogananda":"Yogananda calls this verse 'the guarantee of the spiritual path' and returns to it often in his writings. Abhikrama-nāśo nāsti — no effort is lost — because the soul carries all its spiritual development from life to life. This is why some people awaken to spirituality quickly: they are drawing on the capital of many previous lifetimes of sincere practice. Sv-alpam api — even a little — trāyate: this is God's mercy. The path is not all-or-nothing. Any authentic encounter with this dharma, however brief, creates a seed of liberation in the soul. Mahato bhayāt — from great fear — is the existential dread of the soul trapped in the illusion of separation. Even one moment of genuine meditation begins to dissolve it.","goyandka":"Goyandka explains that this verse provides a crucial distinction between the path of Karma Yoga and the path of Vedic ritual action. In the ritualistic tradition (karma-kāṇḍa), if a sacrifice is left incomplete, it can yield no merit and may even cause detriment — this is pratyavāya. But in the yoga of desireless action, no such risk exists. Every sincere effort accumulates and carries forward across lives — abhikrama-nāśo nāsti. The phrase dharmasya — 'of this dharma' — refers specifically to the dharma of Karma Yoga, nishkāma action guided by buddhi. Mahato bhayāt refers to the ultimate fear: the cycle of saṃsāra, bondage to birth and death. The promise of this verse is therefore nothing less than the assurance that this path leads, however gradually, to complete liberation."}},{"verse":41,"sanskrit":"व्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिरेकेह कुरुनन्दन ।\\nबहुशाखा ह्यनन्ताश्च बुद्धयोऽव्यवसायिनाम् ॥","transliteration":"vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana\\nbahu-śākhā hy anantāś ca buddhayo 'vyavasāyinām","translation":"Here, O joy of the Kurus, the resolute intelligence is one-pointed.

The spiritual path asks for one thing: a mind that does not scatter. Whenever I bring my daily tasks, my worries, my relationships, and my prayers all into the single offering of surrender to God, that is vyavasāyātmikā buddhi. But whenever I try to bargain — a little prayer here, a little pleasure there, a little ambition somewhere else — my mind becomes like a tree with a thousand branches, none bearing fruit. Krishna says to Arjuna: you are a kuru-nandana, a joy of the Kurus — your very identity is noble. Do not let that nobility scatter into indecision. One-pointed love for God and duty is the highest expression of who you truly are.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse draws the sharpest possible contrast: ekā buddhiḥ — one intelligence — versus bahu-śākhāḥ anantāḥ — many-branched and endless thoughts. From the Advaita perspective, the one-pointed intelligence is the intellect that has been purified and turned toward the non-dual Brahman. The irresolute mind, by contrast, is lost in the phenomenal play of the three gunas, generating desire after desire, each spawning further desires, branching without end. Śaṅkara notes that vyavasāya here implies a settled, unshaken determination regarding the nature of the Self and one's relationship to action. This is not mere willpower; it is the clarity that arises when the intellect has truly understood: 'I am not the doer, I am not the enjoyer of fruits.'","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in this verse a precise description of the two mental states all meditators know. In deep meditation, the mind becomes like still water — one, undivided, luminous. This is the vyavasāyātmikā buddhi, the laser-like awareness that can penetrate to the Self. But the ordinary restless mind is bahu-śākhā — branching constantly into memories, plans, fantasies, fears. Every branch pulls energy away from the centre. The spiritual practice is not the suppression of branches by force, but the cultivation of such deep interest in the Inner Source that the branches simply wither for lack of nourishment. One thought of God given with full heart is worth more than ten thousand scattered prayers.","goyandka":"Goyandka explains that vyavasāya means the firm conviction: 'It is my duty to act rightly without desire for fruit — this alone is my concern.' This conviction, when it becomes the very nature of the intellect, is called vyavasāyātmikā buddhi. Those who lack this conviction are driven by desire, and desire is by nature manifold and insatiable — hence bahu-śākhā, many-branched. The Gita here lays down the foundational principle of nishkama karma (desireless action): clarity of purpose collapses the many into the one. A mind that seeks God alone through right action has no surplus energy to feed the proliferating branches of selfish desire."}},{"verse":42,"sanskrit":"यामिमां पुष्पितां वाचं प्रवदन्त्यविपश्चितः ।\\nवेदवादरताः पार्थ नान्यदस्तीति वादिनः ॥","transliteration":"yām imāṃ puṣpitāṃ vācaṃ pravadanty avipaścitaḥ\\nveda-vāda-ratāḥ pārtha nānyad astīti vādinaḥ","translation":"O Partha, men of little wisdom who delight in the letter of the Vedas — who say 'there is nothing else' — utter this flowery speech.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_42.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"पुष्पिताम्","transliteration":"puṣpitām","root":"puṣpa (flower) + ita (past participle suffix)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, feminine, accusative singular","meaning":"flowery / blossoming / adorned with blossoms (of enticing words)"},{"word":"अविपश्चितः","transliteration":"avipaścitaḥ","root":"a (not) + vipaścit (wise, discerning)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"men of little wisdom / the undiscerning / the imprudent"},{"word":"वेदवादरताः","transliteration":"veda-vāda-ratāḥ","root":"veda + vāda (discourse) + rata (delighted in)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"those who delight in Vedic discussions / attached to ritualistic Vedic talk"},{"word":"नान्यदस्ति","transliteration":"nānyad asti","root":"na (not) + anya (other) + √as (to be)","grammatical_form":"Negative existential phrase","meaning":"there is nothing else / no other reality exists"},{"word":"वादिनः","transliteration":"vādinaḥ","root":"√vad (to speak) + in (suffix of agent)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"those who declare / speakers / assertors"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse and the next form a pair that require great care in reading. Krishna is not criticizing the Vedas themselves — he is pointing to a particular misuse of Vedic knowledge. Those who reduce the entire Vedic teaching to a toolkit for gaining pleasures and heavenly rewards are like someone who studies a vast ocean only to collect shells at the shore. Dadaji often said: religion misused becomes the greatest obstacle to God-realization. When a man uses sacred texts to justify his desires — calling his ambition 'dharma' — he is the avipaścit, the unwise one. The flowery speech is beautiful on the outside but empty at the centre, like a flower without fragrance.","sarvapriyananda":"Śaṅkara and later Vedantic commentators make clear that this verse is directed at a specific intellectual tendency: taking the karma-kāṇḍa (ritual action portion) of the Vedas as the whole of Vedic teaching and dismissing the jñāna-kāṇḍa (knowledge portion, the Upanishads). 'Nānyad asti' — 'there is nothing else' — is the signature statement of this position. It is a philosophical materialism dressed in religious garb. The Gita consistently points beyond ritual to Brahman-knowledge. The word avipaścit (undiscerning) is precise: it is not that these men lack intelligence, but that their intelligence has not yet been turned toward the Self.","yogananda":"Yogananda interpreted 'flowery speech' as the appeal of outer religious forms — beautiful ceremonies, impressive rituals, eloquent scriptural debate — that can become substitutes for actual inner transformation. The 'flowers' of religion are lovely but they are not the fruit. One who mistakes the flowers for the fruit remains endlessly in the garden of religious sentiment without ever tasting liberation. This is a compassionate warning from Krishna to all sincere seekers: do not let the beauty of religious form seduce you away from the direct inner work of meditation and self-inquiry that alone leads to the Supreme.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that Krishna here identifies four characteristics of the avipaścit: (1) they are attached to Vedic ritualism (veda-vāda-ratāḥ), (2) they deny any higher reality beyond ritual results (nānyad asti), (3) they are full of desires (kāmātmānaḥ, described in the next verse), and (4) they use beautiful, enticing language (puṣpitā vāk) that appeals to people's lower nature. The danger of this approach is that it uses the authority of sacred scripture to keep the aspirant bound to the very cycle of birth and death (saṃsāra) that scripture's highest teaching aims to dissolve."}},{"verse":43,"sanskrit":"कामात्मानः स्वर्गपरा जन्मकर्मफलप्रदाम् ।\\nक्रियाविशेषबहुलां भोगैश्वर्यगतिं प्रति ॥","transliteration":"kāmātmānaḥ svarga-parā janma-karma-phala-pradām\\nkriyā-viśeṣa-bahulāṃ bhogaiśvarya-gatiṃ prati","translation":"Full of desires, with heaven as their highest goal — they prescribe various specific rites that yield rebirth as the fruit of action, and which lead toward enjoyment and lordly power.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_43.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"कामात्मानः","transliteration":"kāmātmānaḥ","root":"kāma (desire) + ātman (self/soul)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"those whose very self is desire / men whose nature is desire"},{"word":"स्वर्गपराः","transliteration":"svarga-parāḥ","root":"svarga (heaven) + para (highest, supreme to)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"those for whom heaven is the highest / heaven-obsessed"},{"word":"जन्मकर्मफलप्रदाम्","transliteration":"janma-karma-phala-pradām","root":"janma (birth) + karma (action) + phala (fruit) + prada (bestowing)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, feminine, accusative singular","meaning":"bestowing birth as the fruit of action / yielding rebirth as result"},{"word":"भोगैश्वर्यगतिम्","transliteration":"bhogaiśvarya-gatim","root":"bhoga (enjoyment) + aiśvarya (lordship) + gati (path/direction)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, feminine, accusative singular","meaning":"the path directed toward enjoyment and power"},{"word":"क्रियाविशेषबहुलाम्","transliteration":"kriyā-viśeṣa-bahulām","root":"kriyā (rite/action) + viśeṣa (specific/particular) + bahula (abundant)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, feminine, accusative singular","meaning":"abundant in various specific rites / full of elaborate ceremonies"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse completes the description of those seduced by flowery Vedic speech. Their inner state is kāmātmā — desire has become their very self. They are not bad people; they are simply confused about what is highest. When a person's deepest aspiration is 'more pleasures, more power, a better rebirth,' then all their religious activity merely reinforces the very wheel of saṃsāra they hope to transcend. Dadaji used to say: if you perform a thousand rituals but your heart is still turned toward the world, you have only made yourself a more sophisticated worldly person. Turn the heart entirely toward God — that alone breaks the cycle.","sarvapriyananda":"Continuing from verse 42, this verse describes what the 'flowery speech' actually promises: svarga (heaven), bhoga (sensory enjoyment), and aiśvarya (power). These are the three great temptations that the karma-kāṇḍa of the Vedas, when misused, can appear to offer. The crucial phrase is 'janma-karma-phala-pradām' — these rites yield birth as their fruit. This is a devastating critique: rituals performed for selfish ends do not lead to moksha (liberation) but to punar-janma (rebirth). The Vedānta's answer is clear — shift the motivation from phala (fruit) to the Lord Himself, and the very same action becomes a means of liberation.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in this verse a description of what he called 'cosmic delusion working through religion.' Even the highest realms of heaven, he taught, are ultimately impermanent — beautiful but bounded. A soul that strives only for svarga (heavenly enjoyment) will eventually exhaust that heavenly credit and return to earth. The kriyā-viśeṣa-bahulā — the abundance of elaborate rituals — can become a cage of spiritual busyness that prevents the one true practice: turning the mind inward to find the ever-present God within. Religion must ultimately lead beyond religion to direct experience of the Infinite.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that verses 42-43 together constitute a complete warning about what he calls 'sakāma karma' performed under the guise of dharma. The words bhoga (enjoyment) and aiśvarya (lordship/power) represent the two fundamental motivations of the unawakened ego — pleasure and control. Rituals aimed at these ends are legitimate at a certain stage of human development, but the Gita's teaching is addressed to those ready for the higher step: niṣkāma karma, desireless action. The mention of 'janma-karma-phala-pradām' — yielding rebirth as fruit — is the Gita's clearest statement that desire-driven action, however dressed in Vedic language, perpetuates saṃsāra."}},{"verse":44,"sanskrit":"भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानां तयापहृतचेतसाम् ।\\nव्यवसायात्मिका बुद्धिः समाधौ न विधीयते ॥","transliteration":"bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṃ tayāpahṛta-cetasām\\nvyavasāyātmikā buddhiḥ samādhau na vidhīyate","translation":"For those who are attached to pleasure and power, whose minds are carried away by that flowery speech — resolute intelligence is not established in samadhi.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_44.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"भोगैश्वर्यप्रसक्तानाम्","transliteration":"bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānām","root":"bhoga (enjoyment) + aiśvarya (power) + prasakta (deeply attached)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, genitive plural","meaning":"of those deeply attached to enjoyment and power"},{"word":"अपहृतचेतसाम्","transliteration":"apahṛta-cetasām","root":"apa + √hṛ (to carry away) + cetas (mind/consciousness)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, genitive plural","meaning":"of those whose minds are carried away / whose consciousness has been stolen"},{"word":"समाधौ","transliteration":"samādhau","root":"sam + ā + √dhā (to place) → samādhi","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, locative singular","meaning":"in samadhi / in meditative absorption / in the state of inner steadiness"},{"word":"न विधीयते","transliteration":"na vidhīyate","root":"na (not) + vi + √dhā (to establish/ordain)","grammatical_form":"Passive verb, present tense, third person singular","meaning":"is not established / does not become fixed / cannot be ordained"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This is the natural conclusion of the previous two verses: if the mind is colonised by the desire for pleasure and power, there is simply no room left for the steady, one-pointed intelligence that leads to samadhi. It is not a punishment — it is just the truth of how the mind works. A vessel already full cannot receive anything new. Dadaji would say: do not be harsh toward your own desires, but do not feed them either. Each desire fed grows stronger; each desire offered up to God grows weaker. Samadhi is not a distant mystical state — it is the natural peace that floods the mind when desire no longer agitates it.","sarvapriyananda":"The word 'samādhi' here is used in its root sense: samā-dhā — to place equally, to establish in balance. It refers to the state of inner steadiness in which the intellect abides in its own nature rather than being tossed about by desire. Śaṅkara glosses this verse as: the bahu-śākhā buddhi (the many-branched mind of verse 41) is the natural consequence of attachment to bhoga and aiśvarya. You cannot simultaneously pursue scattered worldly ends and maintain the one-pointed discriminative intelligence that illumines the Self. The Gita here is not prescribing asceticism but clarity of priority: what do you actually want most?","yogananda":"Yogananda described the bhogaiśvarya-prasaktā mind as one in which all the energies are flowing outward — toward objects, toward experiences, toward accumulation. Samadhi, by contrast, requires the reversal of this current: all energy flowing inward toward the Self. These two directions are literally incompatible at the same moment. The 'carrying away' of the cetas (consciousness) by desire is what he called 'extroversion of life force' — the opposite of the pranayama and meditation practices that withdraw the life force from the senses. The scattered mind and the concentrated spiritual mind cannot coexist; one must choose.","goyandka":"Goyandka uses this verse to explain why renunciation of desire (vairāgya) is a necessary preparation for jñāna (knowledge). It is not that the Gita demands renunciation of action — it demands renunciation of the desire for fruits. The mind of the bhogaiśvarya-prasakta person is perpetually in motion, calculating, comparing, hoping, fearing. In such a mind, the buddhi cannot settle into the samādhi — the clear, still recognition of one's true nature. Goyandka is careful to note that this is not an impossible standard: even a slight reduction in attachment brings a corresponding increase in inner clarity. The journey begins with the very first step away from desire."}},{"verse":45,"sanskrit":"त्रैगुण्यविषया वेदा निस्त्रैगुण्यो भवार्जुन ।\\nनिर्द्वन्द्वो नित्यसत्त्वस्थो निर्योगक्षेम आत्मवान् ॥","transliteration":"trai-guṇya-viṣayā vedā nistrai-guṇyo bhavārjuna\\nnirdvandvo nitya-sattva-stho niryoga-kṣema ātmavān","translation":"The Vedas deal with the domain of the three gunas; be thou free of the three gunas, O Arjuna — beyond the pairs of opposites, ever established in pure being, free from thoughts of acquiring and preserving, self-possessed.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_45.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"त्रैगुण्यविषयाः","transliteration":"trai-guṇya-viṣayāḥ","root":"tri (three) + guṇa + viṣaya (domain/subject matter)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"having the three gunas as their domain / dealing with the realm of the three qualities"},{"word":"निस्त्रैगुण्यः","transliteration":"nistrai-guṇyaḥ","root":"nis (free from) + trai-guṇya (the three gunas)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"free from the three gunas / transcending the three qualities of nature"},{"word":"नित्यसत्त्वस्थः","transliteration":"nitya-sattva-sthaḥ","root":"nitya (eternal/always) + sattva (pure being) + stha (established in)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"ever established in sattva / always abiding in pure luminous being"},{"word":"निर्योगक्षेमः","transliteration":"niryoga-kṣemaḥ","root":"nis (free from) + yoga (acquiring) + kṣema (preserving/security)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"free from anxiety about getting and keeping / not concerned with acquisition and security"},{"word":"आत्मवान्","transliteration":"ātmavān","root":"ātman (Self) + vat (possessing)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"self-possessed / one who has the Self / established in the Atman"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse is one of the most liberating in the entire Gita. Krishna does not ask Arjuna to reject the Vedas — he asks him to go beyond their domain. The Vedas map the territory of the created world, governed by the three gunas: tamas (inertia), rajas (passion), and sattva (clarity). But Arjuna is being asked to become nistrai-guṇya — to step entirely outside this map, into the Unmapped. Niryo-gakṣema — free from worrying about what to get and what to protect — is the description of one who lives in complete surrender to God. When you know God provides, the energy that was spent on getting and guarding is freed for love. Ātmavān — 'having the Self' — is the simplest possible description of liberation.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse contains one of the Gita's most radical philosophical statements: the Vedas themselves belong to the domain of the three gunas — trai-guṇya-viṣayāḥ. This is not a rejection of the Vedas but a recognition that even the highest scriptural authority operates within the phenomenal realm of prakṛti (nature). The knower of Brahman must transcend even this. Nirdvandva — beyond the pairs of opposites (pleasure/pain, gain/loss, praise/blame) — describes one who is established in the non-dual witness consciousness. Nitya-sattva-sthaḥ does not mean clinging to the guṇa of sattva but abiding in pure existential awareness (śuddha-sattva) that is beyond all three gunas.","yogananda":"Yogananda taught that the three gunas represent the three modes of cosmic energy in which all creation is enmeshed. Even the highest spiritual teachings couched in words (including the Vedas) must ultimately be transcended when the aspirant reaches direct experience of the Divine. He equated nistrai-guṇya with the state of samadhi in which the meditator has fully withdrawn from all sensory and mental modifications and rests in pure Spirit. The phrase ātmavān — 'self-possessed' — was one of his favourite expressions: the person who truly has the Self needs nothing else. All outer possessing is the shadow-play of one who has not yet found the inner treasure.","goyandka":"Goyandka carefully distinguishes the four qualities Krishna prescribes here: (1) nistrai-guṇya — transcendence of the gunas is the ultimate goal; (2) nirdvandva — equanimity toward opposites is its expression in daily life; (3) nitya-sattva-sthaḥ — as a practice, one should abide in sattva as a stepping stone toward transcendence; (4) niryoga-kṣema and ātmavān — non-attachment to acquiring and protecting, and being established in the Self. He notes that this verse sets the agenda for the rest of the Gita's teaching on karma yoga: the yogi acts in the world but is not defined by its results, because the yogi knows the Self to be untouched by all modifications of prakṛti."}},{"verse":46,"sanskrit":"यावानर्थ उदपाने सर्वतः सम्प्लुतोदके ।\\nतावान्सर्वेषु वेदेषु ब्राह्मणस्य विजानतः ॥","transliteration":"yāvān artha udapāne sarvataḥ samplutodake\\ntāvān sarveṣu vedeṣu brāhmaṇasya vijānataḥ","translation":"As much use as there is in a small pond when water floods everywhere — so much value do all the Vedas hold for the brahmin who has attained true knowledge.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_46.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"उदपाने","transliteration":"udapāne","root":"uda (water) + pāna (drinking vessel/well)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine/neuter, locative singular","meaning":"in a well / in a pond / in a small water reservoir"},{"word":"सम्प्लुतोदके","transliteration":"samplutodake","root":"sam + plu (to flood) + udaka (water)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, locative singular","meaning":"when there is flooding water everywhere / when all is inundated with water"},{"word":"तावान्","transliteration":"tāvān","root":"tāvat (so much, to that extent)","grammatical_form":"Correlative pronoun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"so much / to that same extent / proportionally the same"},{"word":"विजानतः","transliteration":"vijānataḥ","root":"vi + √jñā (to know thoroughly)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, masculine, genitive singular","meaning":"of the one who truly knows / of the one with complete knowledge"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse is not a dismissal of the Vedas — it is a magnificent compliment to the Vedas, rightly understood. The Vedas are a well: when you are thirsty and the only water available is in this well, the well is everything. But when a flood of divine grace has come and water is everywhere — when Brahman-knowledge has flooded the entire awareness — the well does not disappear, it simply becomes redundant. Dadaji often said: a realized saint does not throw away the scriptures; he has simply drunk them so fully that he has become what they describe. The pond is not negated; it is fulfilled.","sarvapriyananda":"Śaṅkara's commentary on this verse is illuminating: the analogy of the pond surrounded by flooded water points to a precise relationship. The small pond (udapāna) serves a specific, limited purpose — getting water to drink. When the entire region is flooded, that specific purpose is fully met and exceeded from all directions. Similarly, the Vedas serve a specific purpose: to lead the aspirant toward knowledge of Brahman. The brahmin vijānataḥ — the one who has attained this knowledge — has the very goal of the Vedas fully accomplished. He has not rejected the Vedas; the Vedas have perfectly succeeded in his case. This is Vedānta's own self-completion.","yogananda":"Yogananda loved this verse for its completeness as a metaphor of spiritual illumination. The 'flooding water' is the direct experience of Sat-Chit-Ananda — existence-consciousness-bliss — that floods every corner of the realized being's consciousness. At that point, the wells of scripture, tradition, and doctrine have all been surpassed not by rejection but by total fulfilment. He often used this image when encouraging devotees: 'Do not stop at the pond of outer religious knowledge — seek the flood of inner God-experience that the pond was always pointing toward.' The scriptures are fingers pointing at the moon; the vijānataḥ has seen the moon itself.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that this verse answers a potential objection: if the Vedas are limited to the trai-guṇya domain (as stated in verse 45), does brahma-jñāna make them useless? No — they are not useless, they are fulfilled. The analogy is exact: a small well is not 'destroyed' when floods come; it is simply subsumed. For the ordinary person still on the path, the Vedas are indispensable guides. But for the brahmin vijānataḥ — the knower of Brahman — every injunction of the Vedas finds its natural fulfilment in the state of Self-knowledge. All Vedic duties converge into the single, effortless duty of abiding in the Self."}},{"verse":47,"sanskrit":"कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन ।\\nमा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि ॥","transliteration":"karmaṇy-evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana\\nmā karma-phala-hetur bhūr mā te saṅgo 'stv akarmaṇi","translation":"You have a right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.

'Karmaṇy-evādhikāras te' — your right is only to action, never to the fruit. What does this mean in practical life? It means: give your full effort, your complete dedication, your entire being to whatever you do — but release the outcome completely. The moment you act for a result, you have already introduced the poison of ego into your action. Dadaji taught this as the cornerstone of Swadhyay: do your work as an offering to God, without calculating what you will receive. The fruit is God's business, not yours.\\n\\nBut — and this is crucial — the verse ends with a warning: 'Ma te sango 'stv akarmaṇi' — let not attachment to inaction arise in you either. Inaction is not the answer. The ego finds many clever ways to avoid action — 'I am detached, so I will not act; I am spiritual, so worldly duty is beneath me.' This is a false detachment, a spiritual escape. True Karma Yoga requires full engagement with action, combined with inner freedom from its results.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda considered BG 2.47 the most practically transformative verse in the entire Geeta. From the Vedantic perspective, this verse resolves the deepest paradox of active life: how can one act fully in the world without being bound by anxiety, expectation, and disappointment?\\n\\nThe answer is in the grammar itself. 'Te' — 'to you' — the right to action belongs to you as the individual soul. But 'phaleṣu' — in the fruits — you have no adhikāra, no right, no authority, because fruits arise in the domain of prakriti (nature), not in the domain of your individual choice. You plant a seed; you have done your action. Whether the seed germinates, whether rain comes, whether the fruit is sweet — these are not in your control.\\n\\nThis understanding does not lead to passivity. It leads to extraordinary freedom: act with complete energy and focus, precisely because you are not burdened by anxiety about results.","yogananda":"Paramahansa Yogananda saw this verse as the complete science of action that every human being needs. He often pointed out that most people live in a constant state of tension between wanting to act and fearing the outcome of their actions. This verse dissolves that tension.\\n\\nKrishna does not say 'don't care about results.' He says you have no right to them — meaning, they are not yours to begin with. The cosmic law of karma operates through actions and their consequences. Your only sovereign domain is the quality and sincerity of your effort.\\n\\nYogananda connected this to meditation: when the mind is truly still, it acts with perfect efficiency because it is not burdened by anticipation or regret. Every action becomes a perfect offering into the divine fire.\\n\\nThe verse also carries a subtle warning about the spiritual ego: don't imagine that by withdrawing from action you have transcended it. Inaction for its own sake is just another form of ego. True freedom is found not in escape from the world but in complete, loving, detached engagement with it.","goyandka":"Goyandka's classical Sanskrit analysis reveals the verse's extraordinary precision. The particle 'eva' after 'karmaṇi' is crucial — it means 'only' or 'alone.' Your adhikāra (right, entitlement) extends ONLY to the action itself, not one step beyond. The dative 'te' (to you) personalizes this as a direct command to Arjuna — and through him, to every human being.\\n\\n'Mā phaleṣu kadācana' — the double emphasis: 'mā' (never) and 'kadācana' (at any time, under any circumstance). There is no exception, no moment, no situation in which you have a right to the fruit. This is an absolute statement.\\n\\n'Mā karma-phala-hetur bhūḥ' — and further: do not even consider yourself the cause of the fruit. This is more subtle. Even if the fruit happens to come to you, do not claim authorship of it. The cause of any result is the entire vast network of karma, nature, and divine providence — not the individual actor alone.\\n\\nFinally, 'mā te saṅgo 'stv akarmaṇi' — do not become attached to non-action as if it were superior to action. The Geeta will teach repeatedly: for one who has not yet realized the Self, inaction is not liberation — it is delusion."}},{"verse":48,"sanskrit":"योगस्थः कुरु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा धनञ्जय ।\\nसिद्ध्यसिद्ध्योः समो भूत्वा समत्वं योग उच्यते ॥","transliteration":"yoga-sthaḥ kuru karmāṇi saṅgaṃ tyaktvā dhanañjaya\\nsiddhya-siddhyoḥ samo bhūtvā samatvaṃ yoga ucyate","translation":"Perform your duties established in yoga, abandoning attachment, O Dhananjaya, and be even-minded in both success and failure.

Samatvam yoga uchyate — equanimity is called yoga. This is not the yoga of postures or breathing, not a technical exercise, but a way of being in the world: treating success and failure with the same inner composure. Dadaji taught this as the essential quality of a bhakta — the devotee who has offered their actions and their outcomes both to God. When both are in God's hands, what is there to be agitated about? Act fully, offer completely, rest in equanimity.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse provides the classical definition of yoga that Swami Sarvapriyananda returned to again and again: 'Samatvam yoga ucyate' — equanimity is yoga. Not the technique, not the posture, not the concentration — the fruit of all practice is this quality of being completely balanced in the face of life's oscillations. Success comes: the yogi is grateful but not elated. Failure comes: the yogi learns but is not crushed. This equanimity is not indifference — it is the steadiness that comes from being rooted in the Self, which is beyond both.","yogananda":"Yogananda connected this verse to the practice of Kriya Yoga: all the techniques of yoga are ultimately means to develop this inner stillness — samatvam. The Kriya practitioner learns in meditation to be the witness of all inner states — thoughts, emotions, sensations — without being swept away by any of them. This same quality of witnessing, when developed sufficiently, extends naturally into activity. Then action becomes yoga: fully engaged, completely dedicated, perfectly balanced.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that this verse is the positive complement to the famous 2.47. Verse 47 tells us what NOT to do: don't be attached to fruits. Verse 48 tells us what TO do: establish yourself in yoga and act. The yoga-sthah (established in yoga) is the one who acts from the deepest center of their being, not from the restless periphery of desire.

In Sanskrit, kṛpaṇa means both 'miser' and 'pitiable wretch.' The person who acts only for results is both: a miser because he cannot give freely, and pitiable because he has sentenced himself to constant disappointment. The world will never reliably deliver the results you want — it is simply too large and too complex for any individual to control. The person who demands results from action is like a man demanding that the weather obey his schedule. But the person who takes refuge in buddhi — in the clear intelligence that sees the Self — acts in freedom. This is the secret gift of karma yoga: it liberates the doer.","sarvapriyananda":"The term buddhi-yoga is important and is used here for the first time in a technical sense. Śaṅkara interprets buddhi-yoga as the yoga of equanimous intelligence — acting in perfect inner steadiness, free from the pull of phala. The comparison is stark: karma divorced from this inner orientation (avaram karma) is described as 'dūreṇa' — far inferior — not slightly inferior but utterly different in kind. The instruction 'buddhau śaraṇam anviccha' — seek refuge in intelligence — is a call to make the purified intellect your home, your ground, your shelter. And the word kṛpaṇa — miserable, pitiable — for those motivated by fruit is one of the sharpest critiques in the Gita: the desire-motivated actor is not to be condemned but pitied, for he does not know his own greatness.","yogananda":"Yogananda read buddhi-yoga as the yoga of cosmic intelligence — acting in alignment with the divine wisdom that underlies all of creation rather than from the small, calculating ego-mind. The phala-hetavaḥ (fruit-motivated actors) are kṛpaṇāḥ — spiritually impoverished — because they are drawing from a tiny, limited account of the ego when the infinite treasury of divine intelligence is available to them. The instruction 'seek refuge in intelligence' is the practical instruction of meditation: go inward, contact the deep intelligence of the Self, and act from there. Such actions carry a quality of rightness and effortlessness that mere willful, desire-driven action can never match.","goyandka":"Goyandka explains 'avaram karma' precisely: it refers to sakāma karma — action accompanied by desire for results. Such action is not wrong in an absolute sense — it is appropriate for those at an early stage of spiritual development. But compared to niṣkāma karma unified with buddhi-yoga, it is as inferior as a clay lamp compared to the sun. The instruction 'buddhau śaraṇam anviccha' — 'seek refuge in intelligence' — is an instruction to bring every action under the governance of the purified intellect that has understood the Gita's teaching. Phala-hetavaḥ kṛpaṇāḥ — those motivated by fruits are pitiable — because they voluntarily limit themselves to the smallest possible portion of life's spiritual potential."}},{"verse":50,"sanskrit":"बुद्धियुक्तो जहातीह उभे सुकृतदुष्कृते ।\\nतस्माद्योगाय युज्यस्व योगः कर्मसु कौशलम् ॥","transliteration":"buddhi-yukto jahātīha ubhe sukṛta-duṣkṛte\\ntasmād yogāya yujyasva yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam","translation":"The one endowed with intelligence abandons here both good and evil deeds.

What does skill in action mean? It means acting in such a way that no new karma is generated — not by acting less, but by acting from a deeper place. The buddhi-yukta person abandons 'both good and evil deeds' — not meaning he does no good, but that even his good actions do not create the seeds of future bondage, because they are performed without personal motive or identification. This is the art of living: doing everything fully while remaining interior free. Dadaji used to say: the greatest skill is to live your entire life as an offering, with no attachment to the offering or its reception.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse contains one of the most quoted definitions in the Gita: yogaḥ karmasu kauśalam — yoga is skill in action. But the verse must be read in full context. The buddhi-yukta abandons ubhe — both — sukṛta and duṣkṛta (good and bad karmas). This is a startling claim: even meritorious action, when performed with ego and desire for reward, generates karma that binds the soul to saṃsāra. The skill (kauśalam) of yoga consists precisely in the technique by which action is performed without the ego's fingerprints — without the sense of 'I am the doer' and 'I want the result.' Tasmād yogāya yujyasva — 'therefore yoke yourself to yoga' — is the direct injunction: take up this practice now, as the most urgent priority of your life.","yogananda":"Yogananda loved the word kauśalam — skill, artistry — in this context. The yogi is, above all, an artist of living. Just as a master musician produces music without struggle, without noise, without waste of energy, the karma yogi acts with a natural ease that comes from perfect alignment with the inner Self. This ease is not laziness — it is the supreme efficiency that comes from having eliminated the friction of ego and desire from every action. The abandonment of sukṛta-duṣkṛte — both good and bad karmas — refers to transcending the entire karma-generating mechanism, not by avoiding action but by performing all action as a divine offering, as nishkama seva (desireless service), which creates no binding residue in the soul.","goyandka":"Goyandka's classical analysis of 'kauśalam' is precise: it means the art of performing action in such a way that it does not produce bondage. Ordinary action — whether morally good or bad — generates karma that brings future joy or suffering, binding the soul to rebirth. The buddhi-yukta person performs the same outward actions but with an entirely different inner orientation: without ego-identification, without desire for results, with full surrender to God's will. This inner orientation is the 'skill' (kauśala) that transforms action from a binding mechanism into a liberating one. The conclusion, tasmād yogāya yujyasva — 'therefore yoke yourself to yoga' — is the Gita's most direct command: begin now."}},{"verse":51,"sanskrit":"कर्मजं बुद्धियुक्ता हि फलं त्यक्त्वा मनीषिणः ।\\nजन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ताः पदं गच्छन्त्यनामयम् ॥","transliteration":"karma-jaṃ buddhi-yuktā hi phalaṃ tyaktvā manīṣiṇaḥ\\njanma-bandha-vinirmuktāḥ padaṃ gacchanty anāmayam","translation":"The wise who are endowed with intelligence, renouncing the fruits born of action — freed from the bondage of birth — attain the state that is beyond all suffering.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_51.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"कर्मजम्","transliteration":"karma-jam","root":"karma + ja (born of, produced by)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, neuter, accusative singular","meaning":"born of action / produced by action / the fruit that arises from action"},{"word":"मनीषिणः","transliteration":"manīṣiṇaḥ","root":"manas (mind) + īṣa (ruling) → manīṣin (wise, thoughtful)","grammatical_form":"Adjective used as noun, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"the wise / the thoughtful ones / those of profound understanding"},{"word":"जन्मबन्धविनिर्मुक्ताः","transliteration":"janma-bandha-vinirmuktāḥ","root":"janma (birth) + bandha (bondage) + vi + nis + √muc (to free)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"completely freed from the bondage of birth / liberated from the cycle of rebirth"},{"word":"अनामयम्","transliteration":"anāmayam","root":"an (not) + āmaya (disease, suffering)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, neuter, accusative singular","meaning":"free from disease/suffering / the state beyond all pain / the healthy/whole state"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Anāmayam padam — the state beyond suffering. This is the promise with which Krishna completes the teaching of this section. Dadaji always emphasized that the Gita's promise is not just personal peace or success in life — it is liberation from the root cause of all suffering, which is the false identification with the body-mind and its endless cycle of birth and death. The manīṣiṇaḥ — the truly wise ones — are not those with the most knowledge but those whose intelligence is aligned with the eternal Self. When karma-phala (the fruit of action) is surrendered completely, the mechanism of rebirth has nothing to feed on. The soul, freed of its accumulated weight, rises naturally to its original pristine state — beyond birth, beyond death, beyond all disease of being.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse provides the teleological conclusion of karma yoga: what is the final result of the buddhi-yukta life? Janma-bandha-vinirmuktāḥ padaṃ gacchanty anāmayam — freed from the bondage of birth, they attain the state without suffering. This is moksha described in the most vivid and personal terms: not an abstract metaphysical state but a padam — a place, a position, an attainment — that is anāmaya, literally 'without disease.' The disease being referred to is the fundamental dis-ease of saṃsāric existence: the perpetual oscillation between pleasure and pain, the never-ending seeking and losing, the birth and death that characterizes all conditioned existence. The buddhi-yukta, through consistent practice of action without attachment to fruit, progressively loosens the knots of karma until no karma remains to generate another birth.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in anāmayam padam the description of what he called the state of 'cosmic consciousness' — the superconscious awareness that is completely free of all limitation, all suffering, all imperfection. The karma-jaṃ phalam — the fruit born of action — is the seed of future karma; when this seed is never planted (because the manīṣin acts without desire for results), no future crop of suffering can grow. Janma-bandha-vinirmukta — free from the bondage of birth — means the soul has graduated permanently from the school of earth life, not because it has escaped the world, but because it has fully learned the lesson: the Self is eternally free, and action performed from that freedom generates only light.","goyandka":"Goyandka emphasizes the compound janma-bandha-vinirmuktāḥ: the word vinirmuktāḥ uses the prefix 'vi + nis' indicating complete, thorough liberation — not a partial or temporary freedom but the total severing of all bonds of birth. The Gita's logic is airtight: karma is the seed of rebirth; desire for karma-phala (fruit) is what energizes and plants that seed; therefore the renunciation of karma-phala is the renunciation of the very mechanism of rebirth. The buddhi-yukta manīṣin, through the practice taught in the preceding verses, performs all necessary action while creating no new karmic seeds — and so the accumulated karma gradually exhausts itself without renewal, and the soul attains the anāmayam padam, the state of perfect wholeness and freedom."}},{"verse":52,"sanskrit":"यदा ते मोहकलिलं बुद्धिर्व्यतितरिष्यति ।\\nतदा गन्तासि निर्वेदं श्रोतव्यस्य श्रुतस्य च ॥","transliteration":"yadā te moha-kalilaṃ buddhir vyatitariṣyati\\ntadā gantāsi nirvedaṃ śrotavyasya śrutasya ca","translation":"When your intelligence shall cross over the mire of delusion, then you will become indifferent — dispassionate — to all that has been heard and all that is yet to be heard.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_52.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"मोहकलिलम्","transliteration":"moha-kalilam","root":"moha (delusion) + kalila (mire, thick mud, confusion)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, accusative singular","meaning":"the mire of delusion / the thick mud of spiritual confusion"},{"word":"व्यतितरिष्यति","transliteration":"vyatitariṣyati","root":"vi + ati + √tṛ (to cross over)","grammatical_form":"Verb, future tense, third person singular","meaning":"will cross over / shall transcend / will pass beyond"},{"word":"निर्वेदम्","transliteration":"nirvedam","root":"nis (without) + veda (knowing, feeling) → nirveda (dispassion, indifference)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, accusative singular","meaning":"dispassion / indifference / the state of being unstirred by external information"},{"word":"श्रोतव्यस्य","transliteration":"śrotavyasya","root":"√śru (to hear) + tavya (future passive participle)","grammatical_form":"Gerundive, neuter/masculine, genitive singular","meaning":"of what is yet to be heard / of what ought to be heard"},{"word":"श्रुतस्य","transliteration":"śrutasya","root":"√śru (to hear) → śruta (that which has been heard)","grammatical_form":"Past passive participle, neuter/masculine, genitive singular","meaning":"of what has been heard / of all received scriptural knowledge"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse describes a moment of spiritual maturation that every sincere seeker eventually knows: the moment when the questioning mind finally grows quiet — not because it has been suppressed but because it has been satisfied at the root. Śrotavyasya śrutasya ca — indifferent to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard — does not mean the realized person is ignorant or uncurious. It means the restless seeking that drove the collecting of more and more knowledge has been stilled, because the knower has found what all that knowledge was pointing toward. Moha-kalila — the mire of delusion — is the state where we mistake the map for the territory, the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself. When the buddhi crosses that mire, the moon is seen directly, and no more pointing is needed.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is Vedānta's description of the dawn of viveka (discrimination) in the purified intellect. Moha-kalilaṃ — the mire of moha — is the specific spiritual confusion in which the individual identifies the self with the not-Self: body, mind, ego, social role. When this confusion is penetrated by buddhi, the result is nirvedam — a profound equanimity toward all received knowledge (śruta) and all future knowledge (śrotavya). This is not indifference born of ignorance but the serene self-sufficiency of one who has found the Source. The entire Vedic apparatus of 'hear this, then hear this, then hear this' has accomplished its purpose: the seeker has been led to the shoreline of direct experience, beyond which no further instruction applies. The crossing (vyatitariṣyati) uses the prefix vi + ati — completely crossing to the other side.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in moha-kalila an image of profound accuracy: moha (delusion) is not a transparent fog but a thick mire — kalila — that actively impedes movement, that pulls the traveler back down each time he tries to advance. This is why spiritual progress often feels so difficult: moha is not passive but active, clinging, dragging. But when the buddhi — through the practice of karma yoga, meditation, and discrimination — gathers enough strength to vyatitariṣyati (cross completely over), the transformation is total. Nirveda toward all that has been heard and is yet to be heard means the spiritual practitioner is no longer information-seeking but being-abiding. He has shifted from the mode of the student reading maps to the mode of the traveler who has arrived at the destination.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that nirveda here is not the same as vairāgya (dispassion toward worldly pleasures) — it is something subtler and higher: dispassion toward even scriptural knowledge and spiritual teachings. This is the state beyond study, beyond practice, beyond accumulation of spiritual merit — the state in which the knower knows directly. Śrotavyasya ca śrutasya — both what has already been heard and what remains to be heard — covers all possible scriptural knowledge, present and future. When the buddhi has fully crossed the moha-kalila, no additional information can complete or improve upon the inner knowing that has been attained. This is the condition of the sthita-prajña (one of steady wisdom) whose description will occupy the remainder of Chapter 2."}},{"verse":53,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nश्रुतिविप्रतिपन्ना ते यदा स्थास्यति निश्चला ।\\nसमाधावचला बुद्धिस्तदा योगमवाप्स्यसि ॥","transliteration":"śrī-bhagavān uvāca\\nśruti-vipratipannā te yadā sthāsyati niścalā\\nsamādhāv acalā buddhis tadā yogam avāpsyasi","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: When your intelligence, which has been bewildered by the conflicting declarations of scripture, shall stand immovable and steady in samādhi — then you will attain yoga.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_53.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"श्रुतिविप्रतिपन्ना","transliteration":"śruti-vipratipannā","root":"śruti (scripture heard) + vi + prati + √pad (to go, to fall into)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"bewildered / confused by contradictory statements of scripture"},{"word":"निश्चला","transliteration":"niścalā","root":"nis (without) + √cal (to move)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"unmoved / unwavering / free from agitation"},{"word":"समाधौ","transliteration":"samādhau","root":"sam + ā + √dhā (to place, to hold)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, locative singular","meaning":"in samādhi / in concentrated meditative absorption"},{"word":"अचला","transliteration":"acalā","root":"a (not) + √cal (to move)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"immovable / rock-steady / unshakeable"},{"word":"अवाप्स्यसि","transliteration":"avāpsyasi","root":"ava + √āp (to obtain, to reach)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 2nd person singular, future tense","meaning":"you shall attain / you will achieve / you will reach"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji would often say that the mind caught between competing voices — 'do this ritual,' 'no, do that one,' 'this path is best,' 'no, that one' — is like a boat on a choppy river, moving but going nowhere. Krishna here gently closes the chapter on all that noise. The scripture is not wrong; the contradictions arise because different prescriptions suit different stages of the spiritual journey. But when you have grown beyond choosing between prescriptions — when the buddhi itself rests in samādhi like still water in which the moon's full reflection appears — then yoga, the union itself, is attained. It is not an achievement of effort but the natural fruit of inner stillness. Dadaji used to say: 'When the wind stops, the dust settles on its own.'","sarvapriyananda":"This verse marks the pivot of the Gita's second chapter. Until now, Krishna has been giving instruction — about the immortal Atman, about duty, about the impermanence of the body. But here He points to the goal: samādhi, the state of perfect one-pointed absorption in which the buddhi ceases to oscillate. The śruti-vipratipannā buddhi is the intellect that has heard many paths, many rituals, many injunctions — and is pulled in all directions. Vedanta teaches that this very tossing is the cause of bondage. When the intellect is finally anchored in the recognition of the Self — when it stands acalā in samādhi — all seeking ends. This is yoga: not a practice, but the state that practices are meant to reveal.","yogananda":"Yogananda explains that the 'conflicting voices of scripture' represent the outer-directed intelligence that seeks truth through concepts, arguments, and external authority. So long as the mind is being pulled outward — by ritual, by doctrine, by opinion — it cannot know the still center. But in samādhi, the turbulent mind-lake becomes perfectly calm, and the face of Spirit is seen directly in that stillness. The word 'avāpsyasi' — 'you shall attain' — is Krishna's promise to Arjuna and to every sincere seeker: this is not a vague spiritual ideal, it is a specific inner state that is achievable. Meditation, especially as Yogananda taught it through Kriya Yoga, is the direct means of stilling the intellect into this samādhi-state.","goyandka":"Goyandka notes that this verse concludes the preliminary teaching on buddhi-yoga and prepares the ground for Arjuna's question in the next verse. The key word is śruti-vipratipannā — the buddhi bewildered by hearing many conflicting prescriptions of the Vedas. Some Vedic injunctions urge action, others praise renunciation; some praise one ritual, others another. The immature intellect is lost among them. But Krishna says: when the buddhi stands niścalā — without wavering — in samādhi, the state of perfect inner equilibrium, you will attain yoga. Goyandka explains that this samādhi here is not the technical eight-limbed yoga samādhi exclusively, but the state of settled abidance in knowledge of the Self — the prajñā-pratiṣṭhā described in the following verses."}},{"verse":54,"sanskrit":"अर्जुन उवाच ।\\nस्थितप्रज्ञस्य का भाषा समाधिस्थस्य केशव ।\\nस्थितधीः किं प्रभाषेत किमासीत व्रजेत किम् ॥","transliteration":"arjuna uvāca\\nsthita-prajñasya kā bhāṣā samādhi-sthasya keśava\\nsthita-dhīḥ kiṃ prabhāṣeta kim āsīta vrajeta kim","translation":"Arjuna said: What is the description of one of steady wisdom, established in samādhi, O Keshava?

He has just heard that a person of steady buddhi in samādhi attains yoga — and immediately, lovingly, he asks: 'Tell me, what does such a person look like? How do they talk? How do they sit? How do they walk?' Dadaji said this is not an academic question — it is the question of a devotee who wants to recognize his ideal, to see it before him. And it is also a personal question: 'Is it possible for someone like me, in this body, in this world, to live with steady wisdom?' The answer Krishna gives — spread across the next nine verses — is the most complete portrait of the liberated-yet-living sage in any scripture.","sarvapriyananda":"Arjuna's question is in three registers: bhāṣā (speech — how does he describe himself?), āsīta (posture — how does he sit?), and vrajeta (movement — how does he walk?). These three cover the whole of embodied existence: the use of language, the state of rest, and the state of action. Arjuna is asking: does liberation show? Can we see it in behavior? Vedanta's answer, unfolded over the next verses, is remarkable — yes, it shows, but not through performance or withdrawal. It shows as a quality of inner freedom that expresses naturally through all action. The sthita-prajña is not a person who has stopped living; he is one who lives from a different center.","yogananda":"Yogananda points out that Arjuna's three questions — how he speaks, sits, and walks — correspond to three modes of being: expression, stillness, and movement in the world. He is asking whether divine realization transforms the whole of life. Krishna's answer affirms that it does. The God-realized soul does not speak from ego, sit in anxious calculation, or walk in fear. Every expression, every moment of rest, every movement through the world flows from that unshakeable inner Source. Yogananda often taught that we can recognize the truly spiritual person not by their words alone but by a quality of joy and peace that radiates from their very presence.","goyandka":"Goyandka observes that Arjuna's use of the optative mood — prabhāṣeta, āsīta, vrajeta — 'how would he speak, sit, walk' — reflects a genuine desire to understand the behavioural hallmarks of jñāna. The tradition holds that knowledge (jñāna) must produce a recognizable transformation in the knower. If a person claims realization yet remains controlled by desire, fear, and anger, the claim is suspect. Arjuna's question is thus a methodological one: give me the lakṣaṇa, the defining characteristics, by which I can recognize — and aspire to embody — the state of sthita-prajñā. The word 'keśava' used here — referring to Krishna as the one with beautiful hair or as the slayer of Keśin — subtly invokes divine grace in asking this profound question."}},{"verse":55,"sanskrit":"श्रीभगवानुवाच ।\\nप्रजहाति यदा कामान्सर्वान्पार्थ मनोगतान् ।\\nआत्मन्येवात्मना तुष्टः स्थितप्रज्ञस्तदोच्यते ॥","transliteration":"śrī bhagavān uvāca\\nprajahāti yadā kāmān sarvān pārtha mano-gatān\\nātmany evātmanā tuṣṭaḥ sthita-prajñas tadocyate","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: O Partha, when a person gives up all the desires of the mind, when he is satisfied in the Self by the Self, then he is said to be a person of steady wisdom.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_55.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"प्रजहाति","transliteration":"prajahāti","root":"pra + √hā (to abandon)","grammatical_form":"Present, 3rd person singular, Parasmaipada","meaning":"completely gives up / fully abandons"},{"word":"यदा","transliteration":"yadā","root":"—","grammatical_form":"Correlative adverb","meaning":"when / at the time when"},{"word":"कामान्","transliteration":"kāmān","root":"√kam (to desire)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, accusative, plural","meaning":"desires / longings / cravings"},{"word":"सर्वान्","transliteration":"sarvān","root":"sarva (all)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, accusative, plural","meaning":"all / every one"},{"word":"मनोगतान्","transliteration":"mano-gatān","root":"manas (mind) + √gam (go)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, accusative, plural","meaning":"gone into the mind / dwelling in the mind"},{"word":"आत्मनि","transliteration":"ātmani","root":"ātman (Self)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, locative, singular","meaning":"in the Self / within the Atman"},{"word":"तुष्टः","transliteration":"tuṣṭaḥ","root":"√tuṣ (to be satisfied)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, masculine, nominative","meaning":"satisfied / content / at peace"},{"word":"स्थितप्रज्ञः","transliteration":"sthita-prajñaḥ","root":"sthita (steady) + prajñā (wisdom)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun-adjective, masculine, nominative","meaning":"one of steady wisdom / the established-in-wisdom one"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The Sthitaprajna — the one of steady wisdom — is the Geeta's supreme ideal of human perfection. Dadaji often said: the Sthitaprajna is not a renunciant in a cave, but a person who lives fully in the world — working, serving, loving — yet completely unshaken within. What makes this possible? 'Atmany evātmanā tuṣṭah' — satisfied in the Self, by the Self. Such a person has found the inexhaustible spring of joy within, and therefore does not need to go running after external objects for fulfillment. All desires arise from a sense of lack; when the Self is known as complete, desires naturally fall away — not by force, but by understanding.","sarvapriyananda":"Swami Sarvapriyananda considered this the most psychologically profound verse in the Geeta. The Sthitaprajna is the person who has shifted their source of satisfaction from the world to the Self. This shift is the whole of spiritual life in one formulation. All human suffering arises from seeking satisfaction outside — in wealth, relationships, achievement, pleasure. The Vedantic teaching is not that these things are bad, but that they cannot provide the lasting fulfillment we seek from them. Only when we discover the inexhaustible Self within does this seeking cease — not as suppression, but as completion.","yogananda":"The Sthitaprajna described by Yogananda is not a passionless robot but a person of tremendous inner richness. 'Atmany evātmanā tuṣṭah' — satisfied in the Self alone — means that such a person has found the infinite within. When you are filled from within, you naturally share abundantly without grasping. The Sthitaprajna loves deeply, serves powerfully, and acts decisively — but none of these actions are driven by inner neediness. This is the paradox of spiritual life: the more complete you are within, the more freely and fully you can give without.","goyandka":"Goyandka's classical commentary focuses on the two-step process described in this verse. First: 'prajahāti kāmān' — gives up desires. Note the word 'pra-jahāti': the prefix 'pra' indicates complete, thorough abandonment — not partial restraint but the full dropping of desire. This is only possible when the second element is present: 'ātmany evātmanā tuṣṭah' — satisfied in the Self alone. These two go together. You cannot force yourself to abandon desires; they fall away naturally when you discover a satisfaction so much greater that desires simply lose their pull. The Geeta's path is not suppression but transcendence."}},{"verse":56,"sanskrit":"दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः ।\\nवीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते ॥","transliteration":"duḥkheṣv anudvigna-manāḥ sukheṣu vigata-spṛhaḥ\\nvīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ sthita-dhīr munir ucyate","translation":"He whose mind is not troubled in the midst of sorrows, who is without longing in the midst of pleasures, who is free from passion, fear, and anger — he is called a sage of steady mind.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_56.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अनुद्विग्नमनाः","transliteration":"anudvigna-manāḥ","root":"an (not) + ud + √vij (to tremble, to be agitated) + manas (mind)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective (bahuvrīhi), nominative singular","meaning":"one whose mind is not agitated / untroubled in sorrow"},{"word":"विगतस्पृहः","transliteration":"vigata-spṛhaḥ","root":"vi + gata (gone away) + spṛhā (longing, craving)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective (bahuvrīhi), nominative singular","meaning":"one from whom longing has departed / free from craving in pleasure"},{"word":"वीतरागभयक्रोधः","transliteration":"vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ","root":"vīta (departed) + rāga (passion) + bhaya (fear) + krodha (anger)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective (bahuvrīhi), nominative singular","meaning":"one from whom passion, fear, and anger have departed"},{"word":"स्थितधीः","transliteration":"sthita-dhīḥ","root":"sthita (standing firm) + dhī (intelligence, understanding)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun/adjective, nominative singular","meaning":"one of steady intelligence / one whose understanding is unwavering"},{"word":"मुनिः","transliteration":"muniḥ","root":"√man (to think) or mauna (silence)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"sage / wise one / one who reflects deeply; traditionally one who practices inner silence"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji would often use this verse when someone came to him grief-stricken or frightened. 'Look,' he would say softly, 'the goal is not to avoid sorrow. The sthita-prajña also meets sorrow — duḥkheṣu, 'in sorrows,' the word is plural and real. But his mind does not become agitated by it — anudvigna-manāḥ. And when pleasure comes, he is there for it, but vigata-spṛhaḥ — the craving, the desperate need to hold onto it, has gone.' The triple formula at the end of the verse — free from rāga (passion, clinging), bhaya (fear), and krodha (anger) — represents the three great disturbances of human life. Rāga reaches toward pleasure, bhaya recoils from pain, and krodha arises when either is thwarted. The sage stands free of all three.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse gives us the emotional portrait of the sthita-prajña. From Vedanta's standpoint, all emotional turbulence — agitation in sorrow, longing in pleasure, passion, fear, anger — arises from avidyā, the fundamental ignorance of one's true nature. When the Self is known as infinite and untouched, the emotional system loses its compulsive quality. Note that Krishna does not say the sage has no emotions — he says the mind is not udvig (agitated, distressed) in sorrow. He still meets sorrow; he simply does not drown in it. Similarly, pleasure is still experienced; only the desperate spṛhā — the addictive craving — is gone. The sage is fully present to life but not enslaved by it.","yogananda":"Yogananda speaks of this verse as describing the 'even-minded' yogi — one who has found in God a joy that neither sorrow can diminish nor pleasure can improve upon. He often quoted Emerson's phrase 'the equable man' in connection with these verses. The three pairs here — sorrow and pleasure, then the triple enemy of rāga-bhaya-krodha — map the entire emotional landscape that ordinarily enslaves the soul. Yogananda taught that regular, deep meditation gradually erodes the mechanical reactivity of the senses and emotions, until the meditator discovers the ananda of the Self that remains undisturbed behind all experience. This is not indifference to life; it is the discovery of a joy more real than either pleasure or pain.","goyandka":"Goyandka analyzes the verse carefully. 'Anudvigna-manāḥ' refers to mental equanimity in affliction; 'vigata-spṛhaḥ' refers to freedom from craving in enjoyment. Together they cover the two poles of experience — pain and pleasure. Then the verse goes deeper: 'vīta-rāga-bhaya-krodhaḥ' — free from passion (rāga, attachment to the agreeable), fear (bhaya, aversion to the disagreeable), and anger (krodha, the explosion when desire is obstructed). Goyandka notes that these three — rāga, bhaya, krodha — are the primary modifications of the antaḥkaraṇa (inner instrument) that cause the soul to act in ways that bind it to saṃsāra. The muni who is free of these is the true sage: not one who merely keeps silence externally, but one who has achieved inner silence."}},{"verse":57,"sanskrit":"यः सर्वत्रानभिस्नेहस्तत्तत्प्राप्य शुभाशुभम् ।\\nनाभिनन्दति न द्वेष्टि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥","transliteration":"yaḥ sarvatrānabhisnehas tat tat prāpya śubhāśubham\\nnābhinandati na dveṣṭi tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā","translation":"He who is without attachment everywhere, and on encountering this or that — pleasant or unpleasant — neither rejoices nor hates — his wisdom is steadily established.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_57.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अनभिस्नेहः","transliteration":"anabhisnehaḥ","root":"an (not) + abhi + sneha (affection, stickiness, oil)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, nominative singular","meaning":"without sticky attachment / free from clinging affection toward any person or thing"},{"word":"शुभाशुभम्","transliteration":"śubhāśubham","root":"śubha (auspicious, good) + aśubha (inauspicious, bad)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun/adjective, accusative singular (dvandva)","meaning":"the good and the bad / pleasant and unpleasant outcomes"},{"word":"नाभिनन्दति","transliteration":"nābhinandati","root":"na (not) + abhi + √nand (to rejoice, to be delighted)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person singular, present tense, negated","meaning":"does not rejoice excessively / does not exult over"},{"word":"न द्वेष्टि","transliteration":"na dveṣṭi","root":"na (not) + √dviṣ (to hate, to dislike)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person singular, present tense, negated","meaning":"does not hate / does not resent / does not recoil with aversion"},{"word":"प्रतिष्ठिता","transliteration":"pratiṣṭhitā","root":"prati + √sthā (to stand, to be established)","grammatical_form":"Past participle, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"firmly established / steadily grounded / unshakeably rooted"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The word 'sneha' beautifully captures what attachment really is — sneha means both 'love' and 'oil.' Oil sticks; it clings to everything it touches. Dadaji used to say: 'We can have affection for our family, our work, our devotions — but the moment affection becomes clinging, the moment we cannot bear the loss of what we love, it has become sneha, it has become sticky, and it binds us.' The sthita-prajña is 'sarvatrānabhisnehaḥ' — without this sticky quality everywhere, with everyone, in every situation. This is not coldness — it is freedom. And the result is that when something good arrives he can enjoy it without exulting in it, and when something unwanted arrives he can bear it without hating it. His prajñā — wisdom — stays steady through it all.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse adds the dimension of relationships and outcomes to the portrait. The word 'sneha' is particularly rich: sneha is not merely attachment but a quality of emotional adhesion — like oil, it clings. Vedanta does not ask us to become heartless; it asks us to love without attachment, to be fully present without being enslaved. 'Sarvatrā' — everywhere — means this non-attachment is not selective or situational. It extends to all beings, all outcomes, all circumstances. The test in the second line is concrete: 'tat tat prāpya śubhāśubham' — encountering this and that, good and bad, as they arrive in life — the prajñā does not exult or hate. This equanimity is not practiced; it is the natural expression of knowing that the Self cannot be harmed by any outcome.","yogananda":"Yogananda connects this verse to the state of divine love, which he distinguished from attachment. Ordinary human love, he taught, is mixed with fear of loss — and that fear is precisely the sneha Krishna refers to. Divine love, by contrast, loves all things in God and through God, and is therefore free of the anxiety of possession. The sage 'encounters this and that' — Yogananda notes this realistic acknowledgment that life continues to bring varied events — but the inner center is not displaced by them. He used the image of the ocean: waves of good fortune and bad fortune rise and fall, but the ocean floor is utterly still. The sthita-prajña lives at the ocean floor.","goyandka":"Goyandka distinguishes 'abhisneha' from ordinary affection. All human relationships involve some degree of affection; the problem is 'abhi-sneha' — excessive, clinging attachment that distorts one's vision and makes the soul dependent on externals for its sense of completeness. 'Sarvatrā' (everywhere) ensures this freedom is universal, not merely philosophical. In practice, Goyandka says, the sage experiences pleasant and unpleasant events like everyone else — 'tat tat prāpya' clearly indicates he encounters them — but his response is neither excessive rejoicing ('nābhinandati') nor hatred ('na dveṣṭi'). Goyandka maps these two — rejoicing in śubha and hating aśubha — onto rāga and dveṣa, the twin roots of all karmic bondage described elsewhere in the Gita."}},{"verse":58,"sanskrit":"यदा संहरते चायं कूर्मोऽङ्गानीव सर्वशः ।\\nइन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥","transliteration":"yadā saṃharate cāyaṃ kūrmo 'ṅgānīva sarvaśaḥ\\nindriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā","translation":"When, just as a tortoise withdraws its limbs on all sides, he withdraws the senses from their objects — his wisdom is steadily established.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_58.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"संहरते","transliteration":"saṃharate","root":"sam + √hṛ (to take, to draw back, to withdraw)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person singular, present tense (middle voice)","meaning":"withdraws / draws in / pulls back completely"},{"word":"कूर्मः","transliteration":"kūrmaḥ","root":"kūrma (tortoise)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"tortoise — the animal that draws its limbs under its shell"},{"word":"अङ्गानि","transliteration":"aṅgāni","root":"aṅga (limb, body part)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, accusative plural","meaning":"limbs / body parts"},{"word":"इन्द्रियार्थेभ्यः","transliteration":"indriyārthebhyaḥ","root":"indriya (sense organ) + artha (object, purpose)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, ablative plural","meaning":"from the objects of the senses / away from sense-objects"},{"word":"सर्वशः","transliteration":"sarvaśaḥ","root":"sarva (all) + śas (distributive suffix)","grammatical_form":"Adverb","meaning":"on all sides / completely / in every direction"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji loved this verse. He would sometimes mime a tortoise drawing in its legs when describing the art of pratyāhāra. The tortoise does not destroy its legs — it simply withdraws them, safe inside the shell, and goes on living. So the sthita-prajña does not destroy the senses or pretend he has none. He simply has the sovereign capacity to withdraw them from their objects — to turn attention inward — whenever he chooses. Most people have no such capacity: a pleasant smell pulls the nose, a beautiful sight pulls the eye, and awareness is dragged outward helplessly. The sage is like the tortoise: he can come out, engage the world, and then withdraw completely. That mastery over attention is the hallmark of steady wisdom.","sarvapriyananda":"The tortoise image is one of the most celebrated in all Indian philosophy. Śaṅkarācārya comments at length on it: the tortoise withdraws 'sarvaśaḥ' — on all sides simultaneously. It does not withdraw one limb while another remains extended. Equally, the sthita-prajña does not partially control his senses while allowing one or two to run free. The withdrawal is complete — all senses, from all their objects, simultaneously. This is pratyāhāra — the fifth limb of Patañjali's aṣṭāṅga yoga — described here not as a yogic exercise but as a natural expression of established wisdom. The Vedantic point is subtle: the sage does not need to forcibly withdraw the senses; they naturally follow the mind that has returned to its source in the Self.","yogananda":"Yogananda uses the tortoise image to describe the practitioner in deep meditation. In ordinary waking consciousness, the senses flow outward through the five gates of perception — sight, sound, smell, taste, touch — and the prana (life force) follows them outward. In deep meditation, this flow is reversed: prana is withdrawn inward and upward through the spine, and the senses, following the prana, automatically withdraw from their objects. This is the higher state of pratyāhāra — not a struggle against the senses but a natural, gentle, and complete interiorization of awareness. The tortoise withdraws without effort; it is its natural capacity. The yogi, through practice, recovers this natural inner sovereignty.","goyandka":"Goyandka focuses on the simile's precision. A tortoise withdraws 'aṅgāni' — its limbs — from external exposure into the protection of its shell. Similarly, the wise person withdraws 'indriyāṇi' (the senses) from 'indriyārthebhyaḥ' (their respective objects). Goyandka notes the compound indriya-artha: each sense has its specific object — eye to form, ear to sound, nose to smell, tongue to taste, skin to touch. The tortoise-withdrawal means all five senses are retracted from all five sense-fields simultaneously. This is not aversion to the world but mastery over the direction of one's attention. Goyandka also notes that this verse follows naturally from v57: non-attachment in relation to outcomes (v57) and withdrawal of the senses from their objects (v58) are two aspects of the same inner freedom."}},{"verse":59,"sanskrit":"विषया विनिवर्तन्ते निराहारस्य देहिनः ।\\nरसवर्जं रसोऽप्यस्य परं दृष्ट्वा निवर्तते ॥","transliteration":"viṣayā vinivartante nirāhārasya dehinaḥ\\nrasa-varjaṃ raso 'py asya paraṃ dṛṣṭvā nivartate","translation":"The objects of the senses turn away from the abstinent person, but the taste for them remains.

Dadaji would say: 'You can force yourself to fast from sweets, and the sweets are no longer in front of you — but what about the mouth that still waters at the memory of them? The nirāhāra, the person who abstains, turns away the objects, but the rasa — the inner taste, the residual craving — lingers.' We have all known this. The person who gives up smoking but thinks about cigarettes all day has removed the object but not the rasa. Krishna says: only 'paraṃ dṛṣṭvā' — having seen the Supreme — does even that subtle taste depart. This is why the Gita places Self-knowledge above all disciplines: discipline removes objects; only vision of the Supreme removes the inner craving.","sarvapriyananda":"This is one of the most philosophically significant verses in the Gita's second chapter. It distinguishes two levels of renunciation: the renunciation of objects (nirāhāra — withdrawal of the senses, not feeding them) and the renunciation of rasa — the subtle taste, the residual vāsanā (latent impression). Mere external abstinence leaves the rasa intact; the person is technically non-indulgent but internally still craving. Vedanta's insight is that only the vision of Para-Brahman — the Supreme Reality — dissolves the rasa. This is because rasa is ultimately a misidentification: I want this because I believe it can give me bliss. But when Brahman is directly known as the only source of ānanda, the misidentification dissolves at its root, and with it, the rasa.","yogananda":"Yogananda draws the distinction between willpower-based renunciation and love-based renunciation. When you suppress a craving by sheer will, the suppression may hold — but the inner magnetism toward the sense-object often remains, as an underground current. This is the rasa of which Krishna speaks. The only thing that can dissolve the rasa is the direct experience of a higher joy — 'paraṃ dṛṣṭvā,' the vision of the Supreme. Yogananda taught that this is precisely what deep meditation provides: contact with the inner bliss of the Self, which is so far superior to any sensory pleasure that the senses simply lose their grip. It is not discipline that achieves this but love — the bliss of the Supreme is so much sweeter that desire for lesser things simply falls away.","goyandka":"Goyandka carefully explains the word 'rasa' here: it refers to the subtle taste or flavor of enjoyment — the inner predisposition, the vāsanā — that persists even after external objects are renounced. A person who gives up wine by force of discipline still has the 'taste' for it in the mind; the craving is submerged, not destroyed. This 'rasa' is the seed of future bondage — at a moment of weakness, it sprouts again. Only 'paraṃ dṛṣṭvā' — the direct vision of the Paramātman, the Supreme Self — destroys even this seed. Goyandka connects this to the teaching of the Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad: 'bhidyate hṛdaya-granthiḥ' — when the Supreme is seen, the knot of the heart is cut through, and with it all desires are dissolved at their very root."}},{"verse":60,"sanskrit":"यततो ह्यपि कौन्तेय पुरुषस्य विपश्चितः ।\\nइन्द्रियाणि प्रमाथीनि हरन्ति प्रसभं मनः ॥","transliteration":"yatato hy api kaunteya puruṣasya vipaścitaḥ\\nindriyāṇi pramāthīni haranti prasabhaṃ manaḥ","translation":"For the turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, forcibly carry away the mind of even a discerning person who is striving for mastery.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_60.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यततः","transliteration":"yatataḥ","root":"√yat (to strive, to exert oneself)","grammatical_form":"Present participle, genitive singular","meaning":"of one who is striving / of one making effort"},{"word":"विपश्चितः","transliteration":"vipaścitaḥ","root":"vi + √paś (to see clearly) + cit (consciousness)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, genitive singular","meaning":"discerning / learned / of clear vision and intelligence"},{"word":"प्रमाथीनि","transliteration":"pramāthīni","root":"pra + √math (to churn, to agitate violently)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, neuter, nominative plural","meaning":"turbulent / violently agitating / that which churns and tosses"},{"word":"हरन्ति","transliteration":"haranti","root":"√hṛ (to take away, to steal, to carry off)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person plural, present tense","meaning":"carry away / steal / abduct"},{"word":"प्रसभम्","transliteration":"prasabham","root":"pra + sabha (force, assembly) or pra + √sah (to overpower)","grammatical_form":"Adverb","meaning":"forcibly / violently / by compulsion"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji found great comfort in this verse — and he passed that comfort on to his students. 'Do not be surprised,' he would say, 'when the senses pull you away despite your best efforts. Even a vipaścit — a discerning, learned person — even such a one finds the senses violently seizing the mind and carrying it off. This is not a sign of your failure; it is a description of the human condition.' The verse is honest about the power of the senses — they are pramāthīni, churners, violent agitators. They do not merely invite the mind to wander; they haul it away by force. The teaching that follows (v61) gives the solution: not greater personal effort but surrender to the Lord as the supreme refuge.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is a warning and an honest assessment. Krishna is speaking to Arjuna who has just heard about the ideal of the sthita-prajña — the one established in steady wisdom. Krishna does not want Arjuna — or any student — to think this is achieved easily by mere good intentions and a few disciplines. The senses are 'pramāthīni' — they churn, they are violent, they are relentless. And crucially, 'yatatah api' — even for one who is striving. Even intellectual understanding ('vipaścitaḥ' — discerning, learned) does not automatically confer victory over the senses. This is why the teaching of complete surrender and meditation is necessary. Pure effort of will is insufficient; the source of the disturbance is deeper than the will can reach alone.","yogananda":"Yogananda saw in this verse a description of the spiritual warfare that every sincere seeker must acknowledge and face. The senses are not merely distracting; they are, as Krishna says, 'prasabham' — they work by compulsion, by force. They exploit the pathways of habit and past indulgence. Yogananda likened it to a magnetic field: if you have spent many years building strong grooves of sensory habit, these grooves exert a powerful pull even when your reason tells you to resist. This is precisely why he emphasized the importance of daily, deep meditation — not as a moral exercise but as a physiological restructuring of the brain and prana that gradually weakens the magnetic pull of the senses from the inside.","goyandka":"Goyandka analyzes the compound 'pramāthīni' with care: the root 'math' means to churn violently, as in the churning of the ocean. The senses do not merely nudge the mind toward sense-objects — they churn it, they agitate it with great force. This is their inherent nature (svabhāva), established over many lifetimes of habitual engagement. Goyandka emphasizes 'yatatah api' — even for one who is making effort — because this establishes that effort alone is insufficient. The aspirant must not conclude from his failures that he is uniquely weak; even the vipaścit (the learned man of clear vision) is subject to this assault. The remedy, as the next verse shows, is mat-paraḥ — taking the Lord as the supreme refuge, which is more effective than any strategy of mere personal willpower."}},{"verse":61,"sanskrit":"तानि सर्वाणि संयम्य युक्त आसीत मत्परः ।\\nवशे हि यस्येन्द्रियाणि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥","transliteration":"tāni sarvāṇi saṃyamya yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ\\nvaśe hi yasyendriyāṇi tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā","translation":"Restraining all of them, one should sit in yoga, intent on Me as the highest.

Sit in yoga, focused on Me as the Supreme. Dadaji always emphasized that the word 'mat-paraḥ' — 'Me as the highest' — is the entire secret. Restraining the senses through willpower alone is exhausting and ultimately fails, as v60 showed. But when the heart turns toward the Lord as its supreme delight, as its highest purpose, the senses lose their compulsive hold — not because they are crushed but because a greater attraction has replaced them. 'The iron filings stop running to every small magnet when a great magnet is placed in the room,' Dadaji used to say.","sarvapriyananda":"Krishna introduces a decisive element here: 'mat-paraḥ' — devoted to Me, having Me as the highest. This is not merely the counsel to meditate abstractly but to direct all inner restraint toward the Supreme — toward Brahman, toward God. From the Vedantic perspective, this is supremely important: self-effort without orientation toward the Divine is discipline in a vacuum. It may produce temporary control but not prajñā-pratiṣṭhā — firmly established wisdom. The senses are 'vaśe' — in control — for the sage, and this control is not the result of suppression but of integration. Yukta — in yoga, harmonized — the sage is not at war with his senses; they are aligned, like trained instruments in an orchestra, under the conducting intelligence.","yogananda":"Yogananda reads 'mat-paraḥ' — intent on Me — as the most important phrase in the verse. In his commentary he explains that 'Me' here is not Krishna the historical person but the omnipresent God, the Kutastha Chaitanya, the Christ Consciousness that Krishna embodied and to which he points. Restraining the senses is only the preliminary; the substance of the practice is the interior turning toward the divine Presence. This is bhakti-yoga and jñāna-yoga meeting: the senses are restrained (jñāna's contribution) and the heart is offered to the Lord (bhakti's contribution). When both happen simultaneously in meditation, the prajñā is firmly established — tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā — steady like a lamp in a windless place.","goyandka":"Goyandka presents the verse as giving the two-part solution to the problem stated in v60. Part one: 'tāni sarvāṇi saṃyamya' — restrain all those (senses), each one. Part two: 'yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ' — abide in yoga, taking the Lord as the supreme. Goyandka emphasizes that 'mat-paraḥ' is not merely devotional preference but a complete reorientation of the mind's center of gravity — away from sense-objects and toward the Divine. It is this dual movement — restraint outward and surrender inward — that produces the result: 'vaśe hi yasyendriyāṇi tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā.' For the one whose senses are in his power, not he in theirs — his wisdom stands firm. The verse thus connects sense-mastery directly to the establishment of prajñā."}},{"verse":62,"sanskrit":"ध्यायतो विषयान्पुंसः सङ्गस्तेषूपजायते ।\\nसङ्गात्सञ्जायते कामः कामात्क्रोधोऽभिजायते ॥","transliteration":"dhyāyato viṣayān puṃsaḥ saṅgas teṣūpajāyate\\nsaṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ kāmāt krodho 'bhijāyate","translation":"When a person dwells on objects of sense, attachment to them arises.

He would trace the chain on his fingers: 'Dhyāna — you think about something. Saṅga — you become attached to it. Kāma — you want it. Krodha — you don't get it and you explode.' The whole catastrophe begins, he said, with one innocent-seeming act: dwelling on sense-objects. 'ध्यायतो विषयान् — dwelling on objects.' Not having them, not pursuing them — just thinking about them repeatedly. This is how the poison enters. This is why the tradition places such emphasis on what we allow the mind to dwell upon, what we read, watch, converse about. The mind that dwells on sensory objects is already on the downward chain.","sarvapriyananda":"Verses 62-63 are among the most quoted verses in all Indian philosophy and psychology. They map the anatomy of human downfall with extraordinary precision. Dhyāna here does not mean meditation in the elevated sense — it means the brooding, repeated mental dwelling on sense-objects. When you let the mind roll over and over a desired object, attachment (saṅga) forms: the mind develops a sticky bond with that object. From saṅga, kāma — active desire, the will-to-possess — arises. Kāma is more intense than saṅga: saṅga is attachment, kāma is craving. And when kāma is frustrated — when the desired object is withheld, denied, or threatened — krodha (anger) blazes forth. The progression is inevitable, mechanical, and swift. This is why the Gita places such importance on the management of attention — where the mind dwells determines the fate of the soul.","yogananda":"Yogananda describes this chain as the 'downward spiral of consciousness.' Every step in the chain represents a descent into greater compulsion and less freedom. The process begins subtly — merely 'thinking about' sense-objects, which seems harmless. But Yogananda, as a master psychologist of the soul, knew that the thought is the seed of all subsequent action. He often compared it to watering a plant: water the thought of a sense-object repeatedly, and attachment grows. Water the attachment, and desire flowers. Water the desire with obstruction, and the fire of anger ignites. His teaching was clear: do not water the seed. Give the mind another object of meditation — the Divine — and the chain is broken at its source.","goyandka":"Goyandka presents this verse as the first half of a paired description (with v63) of what he calls the 'saptapada-pātana' — the seven-step fall of the soul. Step 1: dhyāna (repeated mental attention on objects). Step 2: saṅga (attachment). Step 3: kāma (desire). Step 4: krodha (anger) — this verse ends here. The chain continues in v63. Goyandka notes that the verbs are all in the present tense and passive/middle voice — 'upajāyate,' 'sañjāyate,' 'abhijāyate' — they arise on their own, mechanically, once the process is set in motion. The soul does not choose to become attached or angry; these things happen automatically once the brooding on objects begins. This is why the only real intervention is at the very first step: guard what you dwell upon."}},{"verse":63,"sanskrit":"क्रोधाद्भवति सम्मोहः सम्मोहात्स्मृतिविभ्रमः ।\\nस्मृतिभ्रंशाद्बुद्धिनाशो बुद्धिनाशात्प्रणश्यति ॥","transliteration":"krodhād bhavati sammohaḥ sammohāt smṛti-vibhramaḥ\\nsmṛti-bhraṃśād buddhi-nāśo buddhi-nāśāt praṇaśyati","translation":"From anger comes delusion; from delusion, the wandering of memory; from the wandering of memory, destruction of intelligence; from the destruction of intelligence, one utterly perishes.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_63.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"सम्मोहः","transliteration":"sammohaḥ","root":"sam + √muh (to be confused, to lose one's bearings)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"complete delusion / total confusion / loss of discernment"},{"word":"स्मृतिविभ्रमः","transliteration":"smṛti-vibhramaḥ","root":"smṛti (memory, what is remembered) + vi + √bhram (to wander, to be confused)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"confusion of memory / loss of moral and spiritual recollection"},{"word":"बुद्धिनाशः","transliteration":"buddhi-nāśaḥ","root":"buddhi (intelligence, discriminative faculty) + √naś (to perish, to be destroyed)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"destruction of intelligence / annihilation of the discriminative faculty"},{"word":"प्रणश्यति","transliteration":"praṇaśyati","root":"pra + √naś (to perish, to be utterly lost)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person singular, present tense","meaning":"utterly perishes / is completely ruined / is totally lost"},{"word":"स्मृतिभ्रंशात्","transliteration":"smṛti-bhraṃśāt","root":"smṛti (memory) + √bhraṃś (to fall away, to slip)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, ablative singular","meaning":"from the falling away of memory / from the collapse of spiritual recollection"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji would grow quiet when he reached this verse. 'Krodha — anger — this is the tipping point,' he would say. 'After anger comes sammohah — the total darkness of delusion. The angry person cannot think. The angry person cannot remember what they know to be true. The angry person's buddhi is gone — and with it, the person themselves.' He told the story of a great scholar who, in a fit of anger, said things that destroyed a lifelong friendship and ruined his own reputation. 'He knew better. But krodha had produced sammohah, and in that delusion, smṛti-vibhrama — the forgetting. He forgot who he was, who his friend was, what mattered.' Pra-naśyati — he perishes. Not physically. Inwardly. This is the death the Gita warns against.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse completes one of the most psychologically acute passages in world literature. The chain: desire → anger → delusion → loss of memory → destruction of intelligence → utter ruin. Let us be precise about smṛti here — it is not merely factual memory. In the Vedantic context, smṛti refers to the memory of one's true nature, the recollection of one's saṃskāras (spiritual impressions) and dharmic understanding. When anger produces sammohah (complete confusion), this smṛti is lost — the person forgets who they are at a deeper level. With smṛti gone, buddhi — the discriminative faculty that distinguishes right from wrong, real from unreal — is destroyed. And when buddhi is destroyed, 'praṇaśyati' — one perishes. Not necessarily in body, but as a conscious moral-spiritual being. This is the Gita's most serious warning.","yogananda":"Yogananda describes this as the complete dissolution of the 'inner temple' — the structure of spiritual awareness that one has built through years of practice and aspiration. In a moment of uncontrolled anger, he wrote, a person can destroy in minutes what took years to construct. The sammohah (delusion) that anger produces is total: the person cannot see clearly, cannot reason rightly, cannot remember their own better nature. Smṛti-vibhrama is the saddest step — the forgetting of all that one knows to be true about oneself and the Divine. And from that forgetting, buddhi-nāśa: the discriminating wisdom collapses. Praṇaśyati — they are ruined. Yogananda's remedy is always the same: daily meditation that keeps the channel to the inner Self open and clear, so that even in provocation, the thread back to the center is not lost.","goyandka":"Goyandka completes his seven-step analysis: Step 4 (from v62): krodha (anger). Step 5: sammohah (complete delusion — the total confusion of perception and judgment). Step 6: smṛti-vibhrama (the wandering/disturbance of memory — specifically the loss of discriminative recollection built through study and practice, the smṛti of scripture and dharma). Step 7: buddhi-nāśa (the destruction of the discriminative faculty). The terminal result: praṇaśyati — utter perdition. Goyandka observes the escalating severity of the verbs: 'bhavati' (comes to be), 'vibhrama' (wandering confusion), 'nāśa' (destruction), and finally 'pra-naśyati' — the 'pra' prefix intensifying the destruction to completeness. Each step destroys something more fundamental than the last, until nothing of the spiritually conscious person remains. This chain is the reason the Gita begins its positive teaching with the immortal Atman — only an identity rooted in the Self can resist this cascade."}},{"verse":64,"sanskrit":"रागद्वेषवियुक्तैस्तु विषयानिन्द्रियैश्चरन् ।\\nआत्मवश्यैर्विधेयात्मा प्रसादमधिगच्छति ॥","transliteration":"rāga-dveṣa-viyuktais tu viṣayān indriyaiś caran\\nātma-vaśyair vidheyātmā prasādam adhigacchati","translation":"But the self-disciplined man, moving among sense objects with senses governed by the Self — free from attraction and aversion — attains tranquillity (prasāda).","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_64.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"रागद्वेषवियुक्तैः","transliteration":"rāga-dveṣa-viyuktaiḥ","root":"rāga (attraction) + dveṣa (aversion) + vi + √yuj (to yoke, to join)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, instrumental plural","meaning":"free from / uncoupled from attraction and aversion"},{"word":"आत्मवश्यैः","transliteration":"ātma-vaśyaiḥ","root":"ātman (Self) + vaśya (under control of)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, instrumental plural","meaning":"governed by the Self / under the Self's sway"},{"word":"विधेयात्मा","transliteration":"vidheyātmā","root":"vi + √dhā (to place) + ātman (self/mind)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, nominative singular","meaning":"one whose self/mind is disciplined / obedient"},{"word":"प्रसादम्","transliteration":"prasādam","root":"pra + √sad (to sit, to be clear, to settle)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, accusative singular","meaning":"tranquillity / grace / serene clarity of mind"},{"word":"अधिगच्छति","transliteration":"adhigacchati","root":"adhi + √gam (to go, to attain)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person singular, present tense","meaning":"attains / reaches / comes to"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji always smiled when he reached this verse and said: 'Krishna is not asking us to run away from the world. He is asking us to walk through it differently.' The bhogi (pleasure-seeker) moves among sense objects driven by rāga — clinging to what pleases — and dveṣa — pushing away what displeases. The yogi moves through the very same world, among the very same objects, but the senses are now leashed to the Self within. It is like the difference between a dog dragging its master through the street and a well-trained dog walking calmly at its master's side. The world has not changed. The streets have not changed. Only the inner relationship has changed. And out of that one inner change flows prasāda — that soft, luminous peace that Dadaji called 'the fragrance of the soul.' This verse is a great assurance: renunciation is an inner act, not a physical flight.","sarvapriyananda":"Having described in the previous verses the chaos that follows uncontrolled senses, Krishna now presents the positive counter-image: the vidheyātmā, the one whose inner instrument is disciplined. Two key phrases deserve close attention. 'Ātma-vaśyaiḥ' means the senses are controlled not by suppression but by the Self — they have been subordinated to the higher principle of pure awareness. And 'rāga-dveṣa-viyuktaiḥ' points to the Vedantic understanding that bondage is not caused by contact with the world but by the psychological reactions of attraction and aversion. The liberated one moves freely in the world — 'viṣayān caran' — because contact without attachment generates no karma, no agitation. The result is prasāda: the natural luminosity of a mind no longer muddied by likes and dislikes. This is the Vedantic ideal of jīvan-mukti, liberation while living.","yogananda":"Yogananda teaches that rāga and dveṣa — attraction and repulsion — are the two poles of ego-consciousness, the very mechanism by which the soul becomes entrapped in the drama of the senses. The cosmic delusion of māyā operates precisely through these two forces: it lures the soul toward pleasant sensations and drives it away from unpleasant ones, keeping it perpetually spinning. The yogi who has awakened his inner Self — through meditation, through the awakening of the spine's inner current — finds that the senses still function but no longer generate the voltage of desire. He tastes, sees, hears, but is not seized. Prasāda, Yogananda explains, is not merely peace but a state of inner radiance — the mind becomes like a polished mirror that reflects Spirit. It is the beginning of direct God-perception.","goyandka":"Goyandaka explains that vidheyātmā — one whose mind (antaḥkaraṇa) is made obedient — is the essential qualification for the path of knowledge. When the mind is no longer pulled by the twin currents of rāga and dveṣa, it naturally becomes receptive to the light of viveka (discrimination). The term ātma-vaśya is important: the senses are not destroyed but brought under the dominion of the higher self. The Gita does not advocate dry suppression (nigraha in a violent sense) but a graceful mastery that comes through consistent practice and dispassion (abhyāsa and vairāgya). Prasāda — inner serenity — is the direct outcome, and it is not a reward granted from outside but the mind's own natural condition when the agitation of attraction and aversion ceases. This verse establishes the positive path after the warning of verses 62–63."}},{"verse":65,"sanskrit":"प्रसादे सर्वदुःखानां हानिरस्योपजायते ।\\nप्रसन्नचेतसो ह्याशु बुद्धिः पर्यवतिष्ठते ॥","transliteration":"prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṃ hānir asyopajāyate\\nprasanna-cetaso hy āśu buddhiḥ paryavatiṣṭhate","translation":"In that tranquillity, there is the cessation of all sorrows.

The reason, he said, is that we look for the exit in the wrong place. We try to rearrange the outer world when the answer lies in the quality of the inner world. This verse is Krishna's gentle promise: attain prasāda — that inner serenity of verse 64 — and all sorrow falls away of itself. Not one sorrow here and another there, but sarva-duḥkhānāṃ hāniḥ — the cessation of all sorrows. And then the buddhi, freed from grief and agitation, quickly becomes steady. Dadaji would fold his hands when reciting this verse and say, 'This is the only real medicine. All else is temporary relief.'","sarvapriyananda":"The logical flow of this verse is impeccable. Prasāda — inner clarity — is not merely pleasant; it is causally efficacious. It destroys all sorrow (sarva-duḥkhānāṃ hāniḥ). From a Vedantic standpoint, sorrow arises from the superimposition of limitation and mortality upon the infinite Self. When the mind is prasanna — clear, unagitated — it is in a condition closer to its own true nature as pure awareness. In that nearness to the Self, the projections of grief and loss do not find purchase. And simultaneously, the buddhi — the discriminating intelligence — becomes firmly established (paryavatiṣṭhate). The word 'āśu' — swiftly — is significant: Vedanta does not promise a distant future result; in the tranquil mind, right understanding dawns quickly. This verse describes the self-reinforcing upward spiral of the spiritual life.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees in this verse the description of a profound inner alchemy. When the meditating devotee attains that state of prasāda — the joy-saturated calmness that comes in deep meditation — the accumulated karmic impressions that generate suffering begin to dissolve. Yogananda called this the 'cauterizing' effect of divine joy: the bliss of samādhi burns away the seeds of sorrow just as a flame burns seeds so they can no longer sprout. 'Sarva-duḥkhānāṃ hāniḥ' is not a vague promise but a description of spiritual law. The prasanna-cetas — the mind luminous with inner joy — is no longer fertile ground for anguish. And in that joyful clarity, the buddhi finds its natural ground and stands steady. This is why Yogananda taught meditation not as a discipline of suppression but as cultivation of divine joy.","goyandka":"Goyandaka notes the precise sequence: prasāda (verse 64) leads to the destruction of sorrow (verse 65), which in turn stabilizes the buddhi. This is the Gita's practical psychology laid out step by step. The phrase 'sarva-duḥkhānāṃ hāniḥ' is comprehensive — not merely the reduction of sorrow but its complete cessation. This is because sorrow ultimately has one root: the restless, desire-driven mind. When that restlessness is stilled in prasāda, there is no longer a medium in which sorrow can exist. Goyandaka also emphasizes 'āśu' — quickly or swiftly. The scriptures promise that the seeker who has genuinely attained inner tranquillity does not wait long for steady wisdom; the discrimination between the real and the unreal becomes clear with remarkable speed, because clarity is the mind's natural state once agitation subsides."}},{"verse":66,"sanskrit":"नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना ।\\nन चाभावयतः शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुतः सुखम् ॥","transliteration":"nāsti buddhir ayuktasya na cāyuktasya bhāvanā\\nna cābhāvayataḥ śāntir aśāntasya kutaḥ sukham","translation":"There is no wisdom for the unsteady; no meditation for the unsteady; no peace for the one without meditation — and for the unpeaceful, where is happiness?","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_66.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अयुक्तस्य","transliteration":"ayuktasya","root":"a (not) + √yuj (to yoke, to unite, to discipline)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, genitive singular","meaning":"of the undisciplined / of one not yoked / of the unsteady"},{"word":"भावना","transliteration":"bhāvanā","root":"√bhū (to become, to be) causative","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"meditation / contemplation / sustained reflection"},{"word":"अभावयतः","transliteration":"abhāvayataḥ","root":"a (not) + bhāvana (contemplating, meditating)","grammatical_form":"Participle, genitive singular","meaning":"of one who does not meditate / who does not contemplate"},{"word":"शान्तिः","transliteration":"śāntiḥ","root":"√śam (to be calm, to cease)","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"peace / tranquillity / cessation of agitation"},{"word":"कुतः","transliteration":"kutaḥ","root":"interrogative particle","grammatical_form":"Indeclinable interrogative adverb","meaning":"from where / how / whence"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji loved this verse for its unflinching honesty. He said Krishna here lays out a simple chain: no discipline, no real wisdom; no real wisdom, no meditation; no meditation, no peace; no peace — and this is the final arrow — no happiness. 'Aśāntasya kutaḥ sukham?' Where is happiness for the unpeaceful? Dadaji would pause after that question and let it hang in the air for a long moment. 'Just ask yourself,' he would say softly, 'are you at peace? If not, stop searching for happiness in the next experience, the next achievement, the next relationship. The unpeaceful heart cannot hold happiness even if the whole world is placed in its hands. It leaks out immediately.' This verse, he said, is not a rebuke but an invitation to turn inward.","sarvapriyananda":"This is one of the most structurally elegant verses in the Gita. Krishna builds a descending chain of negations — each absence causing the next — to demonstrate with cold logic why the undisciplined life is a life of guaranteed misery. Ayuktasya nāsti buddhiḥ: the undisciplined cannot access discriminating wisdom, because the buddhi is clouded by desire and emotion. Without buddhi, bhāvanā — the sustained meditative contemplation that leads to realization — is impossible. Without bhāvanā, śānti does not arise. And without śānti, sukha — lasting happiness — is utterly out of reach. The Vedantic insight here is that happiness is not found; it is uncovered. It is the Self's own nature. But it can only be uncovered in the śānta mind. Every worldly pursuit of happiness that bypasses inner peace is, by this verse's logic, structurally doomed.","yogananda":"Yogananda explains this verse as a description of the law of spiritual causation. 'Ayukta' means one who is not in yoga — not united with the inner Self through meditation. For such a person, he says, true buddhi — intuitive wisdom that perceives the real — simply does not arise. The ordinary intellect of such a person may be brilliant in worldly matters but remains blind to the deeper Reality. And without that wisdom-perception, the mind cannot sustain the inner contemplation (bhāvanā) that leads to peace. Yogananda often pointed out that no amount of external success, pleasure, or comfort can confer the peace this verse describes. 'Aśāntasya kutaḥ sukham?' — the unquiet soul is restless whether in a palace or a cave. Only yoga — inner union — delivers genuine happiness.","goyandka":"Goyandaka presents this verse as a rigorous logical syllogism establishing that inner discipline is the only foundation for a meaningful life. The ayukta — the one whose mind is not regulated, not concentrated — lacks buddhi not in the sense of ordinary intelligence but in the specific Gita-sense of the discriminating wisdom that distinguishes the eternal from the transient. This being absent, bhāvanā — the sustained mental dwelling on the Supreme that constitutes true meditation — cannot occur. Without bhāvanā, śānti is impossible; and śānti being absent, sukha — true happiness as opposed to momentary pleasure — cannot exist. Goyandaka emphasizes that 'kutaḥ sukham?' is a rhetorical question that admits no answer: there is simply no happiness for the unpeaceful. This is why the Gita's entire discipline aims first at inner steadiness."}},{"verse":67,"sanskrit":"इन्द्रियाणां हि चरतां यन्मनोऽनुविधीयते ।\\nतदस्य हरति प्रज्ञां वायुर्नावमिवाम्भसि ॥","transliteration":"indriyāṇāṃ hi caratāṃ yan mano 'nuvidhīyate\\ntad asya harati prajñāṃ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi","translation":"For when the mind follows the wandering senses, it carries away one's wisdom as the wind carries a boat on the waters.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_67.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"इन्द्रियाणाम्","transliteration":"indriyāṇām","root":"indriya (sense organ, faculty of Indra)","grammatical_form":"Noun, neuter, genitive plural","meaning":"of the senses / of the sense faculties"},{"word":"अनुविधीयते","transliteration":"anuvidhīyate","root":"anu (following) + vi + √dhā (to place, to follow)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person singular, passive present","meaning":"follows after / is led by / dances to the tune of"},{"word":"हरति","transliteration":"harati","root":"√hṛ (to take, to carry away, to steal)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person singular, present tense","meaning":"carries away / steals / sweeps away"},{"word":"प्रज्ञाम्","transliteration":"prajñām","root":"pra + √jñā (to know)","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, accusative singular","meaning":"wisdom / deep intuitive understanding / discernment"},{"word":"वायुः","transliteration":"vāyuḥ","root":"√vā (to blow)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"wind / air"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji described this verse as a picture painted with just a few words — and what a vivid picture it is. Imagine a boat on dark waters. A strong wind comes. The sailor is helpless; the boat is swept wherever the wind wills. That is the mind that chases the senses. One attractive sight, one appealing sound, one tempting taste — and the mind abandons all it knew, all its spiritual effort, all its hard-won clarity. Prajñā — not just ordinary knowledge but the deep, earned wisdom of spiritual practice — is simply swept away. Dadaji would say, 'The danger is not that the senses are strong. The danger is that the mind volunteers to follow them. It is not kidnapped — it runs.' The cure, he said, is to develop such love for the inner state of peace that the mind simply has no desire to run after the senses.","sarvapriyananda":"The simile in this verse is one of the Gita's finest: the wind and the boat on water. Notice the precise mechanics Krishna describes. The senses wander — 'caratāṃ' — that is their nature; they are designed to reach outward to their objects. The problem is not the senses wandering; the problem is 'yan mano 'nuvidhīyate' — when the mind follows after them. The mind is the pivot. When the mind goes after the senses, the entire ship of discriminative wisdom is at the mercy of the winds of sense-experience. Prajñā — the Atman-revealing intelligence — is not merely confused; it is carried away (harati). From a Vedanta perspective, this verse explains why mere intellectual knowledge of Vedanta is insufficient for liberation: if the mind is sense-bound, no amount of scriptural learning translates into realization. The mind must first be steadied.","yogananda":"Yogananda finds in this verse a precise description of what happens to the meditator who has not fully interiorized the mind. In meditation, there are moments of deep calm — and then a sound, a physical sensation, a stray thought connected to a sense impression arises, and the mind races outward. The fragile boat of concentration is blown off course in an instant. He teaches that this is why the progressive stages of Patanjali's yoga — pratyāhāra (withdrawal of senses), dhāraṇā (concentration), and dhyāna (meditation) — must be cultivated step by step. The wind cannot be stopped, but the boat can be anchored. Interiorization through systematic meditation techniques anchors the mind in the spinal centers so deeply that the outer winds of sense-experience lose their power to sweep it away.","goyandka":"Goyandaka draws attention to the word 'hi' — 'indeed' or 'truly' — with which the verse begins. This particle indicates that the statement is being offered as self-evident truth, a fact of practical experience that every sincere seeker has observed in themselves. The image of the boat swept by wind on water perfectly conveys both the suddenness and the completeness of the loss: prajñā is not merely obscured but carried away (harati). Goyandaka also notes that this verse explains why the previous verse spoke of no bhāvanā for the undisciplined: once the wind-mind follows the senses, all possibility of sustained contemplation is destroyed. The cure is the practice described in verse 64 — bringing the senses under the dominion of the Self — and the result is the prasāda of verse 65. These verses form a tightly interlocked teaching."}},{"verse":68,"sanskrit":"तस्माद्यस्य महाबाहो निगृहीतानि सर्वशः ।\\nइन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेभ्यस्तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता ॥","transliteration":"tasmād yasya mahā-bāho nigṛhītāni sarvaśaḥ\\nindriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas tasya prajñā pratiṣṭhitā","translation":"Therefore, O mighty-armed, he whose senses are completely withdrawn from sense objects in every way — his wisdom is firmly established.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_68.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"निगृहीतानि","transliteration":"nigṛhītāni","root":"ni + √grah (to seize, to restrain, to hold)","grammatical_form":"Past passive participle, neuter, nominative plural","meaning":"completely restrained / fully withdrawn / firmly held back"},{"word":"सर्वशः","transliteration":"sarvaśaḥ","root":"sarva (all, every)","grammatical_form":"Adverb (derived from adjective)","meaning":"in every way / completely / from all sides"},{"word":"इन्द्रियार्थेभ्यः","transliteration":"indriyārthebhyaḥ","root":"indriya (senses) + artha (object, purpose)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, neuter, ablative plural","meaning":"from sense objects / from the objects of the senses"},{"word":"प्रतिष्ठिता","transliteration":"pratiṣṭhitā","root":"prati + √sthā (to stand, to be established)","grammatical_form":"Past passive participle, feminine, nominative singular","meaning":"firmly established / steadily grounded / well-settled"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji called this verse 'the positive conclusion' — after warning us about what happens when senses run wild, Krishna now states directly what steady wisdom looks like. The word 'sarvaśaḥ' — in every way, completely — is what Dadaji always highlighted. He said, 'Not the senses withdrawn from most objects. Not the senses withdrawn sometimes. Sarvaśaḥ — completely.' He would smile and add: 'This is not cruelty to the senses. It is freedom from being a slave to them.' And 'mahā-bāho' — mighty-armed — is not accidental. Krishna addresses the warrior in Arjuna, recognizing the enormous strength required for this inner battle. The one who achieves it earns the real title of hero: not the hero of the battlefield, but the hero of the inner life, whose prajñā is firmly established like a lamp in a windless place.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the positive counterpart to verse 67 and the logical conclusion of this entire section. 'Tasmāt' — therefore — connects directly to the preceding teaching: because an uncontrolled mind loses all wisdom, therefore the one who has controlled the senses finds wisdom fully established. 'Nigṛhītāni sarvaśaḥ' — withdrawn completely — suggests not selective or partial restraint but a total reorientation of the cognitive apparatus. The senses are withdrawn from 'indriyārtha' — their objects — meaning the mind-sense complex is no longer outward-reaching but has turned toward the Self. In Vedantic terms this is pratyāhāra fully accomplished. Prajñā pratiṣṭhitā — established wisdom — refers to the buddhi that now abides in its own source, the Ātman, rather than being dispersed across sense objects. This is the sthita-prajña of the Gita.","yogananda":"Yogananda sees in this verse the fruit of the deep meditative practice he called 'interiorization.' 'Nigṛhītāni sarvaśaḥ' — the senses completely restrained — corresponds to the advanced stages of meditation in which the life-force is actually withdrawn from the sensory nerves and gathered at the spinal centers. In this state, the outer world simply does not impinge upon consciousness; the meditator has, as Yogananda described, 'pulled the telephones out of their sockets.' What remains is the pure luminosity of the Self, and in that luminosity, prajñā — intuitive wisdom — stands firmly established. This is not unconsciousness but superconscious awareness. Yogananda taught that Kriya Yoga was specifically designed to achieve this complete withdrawal and the lasting wisdom it produces.","goyandka":"Goyandaka observes that this verse completes a carefully constructed argument spanning verses 62 through 68. Verse 62 described how desire arises from dwelling on sense objects; verses 63–67 traced the cascading consequences; verse 68 now declares the way out and the reward. The word 'nigṛhītāni' — restrained — should be understood in the context of the full Gita teaching: this restraint is not achieved by brute force (which Krishna elsewhere says merely suppresses the senses while the mind still dwells on objects) but by the higher detachment that comes from God-realization. 'Sarvaśaḥ' — in all respects — indicates that no loophole is left: not one sense, not one type of object, remains a conduit for distraction. The result is prajñā pratiṣṭhitā — wisdom that stands as unshakeably as a mountain."}},{"verse":69,"sanskrit":"या निशा सर्वभूतानां तस्यां जागर्ति संयमी ।\\nयस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुनेः ॥","transliteration":"yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṃ tasyāṃ jāgarti saṃyamī\\nyasyāṃ jāgrati bhūtāni sā niśā paśyato muneḥ","translation":"That which is night for all beings is the time of waking for the self-controlled.

He would close his eyes after reciting it. 'Think about it,' he would say. 'The world is wide awake to things: money, status, pleasure, fear, competition. The sage looks at all this and sees — night. Darkness. Not even real. And the world looks at what the sage is awake to — silence, the Self, the eternal Presence — and sees nothing, emptiness, a kind of madness or irrelevance. Two beings walking the same earth, living in completely different worlds.' He said this verse is not a condemnation of ordinary people. It is simply an honest description of how completely different the two orientations of consciousness are. 'Paśyato muneḥ' — the seeing sage — sees what others cannot.","sarvapriyananda":"This is perhaps the most philosophically concentrated verse in the second chapter. It describes the complete inversion of values between ordinary consciousness and the awakened sage's vision. For all beings (sarva-bhūtānām) the ultimate Reality — the Ātman, pure Awareness — is like night: they simply cannot see it, are asleep to it, unaware of its existence. But the saṃyamī — the self-controlled one — is fully awake in precisely that realm of pure consciousness that the world sleeps through. Conversely, the world of name, form, pleasure, and achievement that ordinary beings are keenly awake to — the saṃsāra — is night for the paśyato muniḥ, the seeing sage. He is not merely indifferent to it; it has become phenomenologically dim, like a dream recollected after waking. This verse encapsulates the Vedantic teaching that the waking state of the world is itself a form of collective ignorance.","yogananda":"Yogananda calls this verse a perfect description of the two states of consciousness — cosmic ignorance and cosmic wakefulness — that the Gita's entire teaching is designed to distinguish. The 'night' of the Self — the realm of pure Spirit, of ānanda, of the God within — is utterly dark and impenetrable to the sense-bound mind. But the meditator who has turned his consciousness inward through kriyā and praṇāyāma finds himself awake in a luminous inner world, while the noisy, colorful, seemingly vivid world of the senses has become shadowy and unreal. Yogananda taught his students to seek that reversal — to become, through daily meditation, increasingly 'asleep' to the world's distractions and increasingly 'awake' to the ever-present bliss of the inner Self. The verse is both a description and an encouragement.","goyandka":"Goyandaka explains this verse through the lens of viveka — discrimination between the real and the unreal. The 'night' and 'wakefulness' are not literal but refer to two fundamentally different orientations of consciousness. For the ordinary person, the empirical world of pleasure and pain is vivid, real, and fully illuminated — they are wide awake to it. But the transcendent Self, pure and eternal, is 'night' to them — invisible, unperceived, beyond their experience. The saṃyamī — the disciplined seeker established in the Self — has the opposite perception: worldly objects and experiences have lost their vivid fascination (they have become 'night'), while the Self shines with undeniable luminosity (he is fully 'awake' in it). This is the meaning of brahma-niṣṭhā: being established in Brahman so completely that the world's spell is broken."}},{"verse":70,"sanskrit":"आपूर्यमाणमचलप्रतिष्ठं\\nसमुद्रमापः प्रविशन्ति यद्वत् ।\\nतद्वत्कामा यं प्रविशन्ति सर्वे\\nस शान्तिमाप्नोति न कामकामी ॥","transliteration":"āpūryamāṇam acala-pratiṣṭhaṃ\\nsamudram āpaḥ praviśanti yadvat\\ntadvat kāmā yaṃ praviśanti sarve\\nsa śāntim āpnoti na kāma-kāmī","translation":"As all waters flow into the ocean — which is ever full and remains unmoved — so the person into whom all desires enter without disturbing him attains peace; not the one who craves desires.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_70.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"आपूर्यमाणम्","transliteration":"āpūryamāṇam","root":"ā + √pṛ (to fill completely)","grammatical_form":"Present passive participle, accusative singular","meaning":"being continually filled / ever-full / receiving all waters"},{"word":"अचलप्रतिष्ठम्","transliteration":"acala-pratiṣṭham","root":"a (not) + √cal (to move) + prati + √sthā (to stand)","grammatical_form":"Compound adjective, accusative singular","meaning":"unmoved / whose foundation is unshakeable / immovably established"},{"word":"कामाः","transliteration":"kāmāḥ","root":"√kam (to desire, to love)","grammatical_form":"Noun, masculine, nominative plural","meaning":"desires / sense cravings / longings"},{"word":"शान्तिम्","transliteration":"śāntim","root":"√śam (to be calm, to subside)","grammatical_form":"Noun, feminine, accusative singular","meaning":"peace / tranquillity / the supreme calm"},{"word":"कामकामी","transliteration":"kāma-kāmī","root":"kāma (desire) + kāmin (one who desires)","grammatical_form":"Compound noun, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"one who craves desires / the desirer of desires"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji said this verse stopped him in his tracks the very first time he heard it as a young man. The image is staggering: the ocean. Rivers pour into it from every direction, all day and all night, year after year, century after century — and the ocean does not overflow, does not become restless, does not jump up in excitement and say 'more, more!' It simply receives all of it and remains what it is: full, vast, unmoved. This is the inner life of the wise. Desires — the rivers of the world — do enter. Krishna does not say the sage has no desires entering him. He says the desires enter him as rivers enter the ocean: they disappear into him without disturbing him. The kāma-kāmī — the one who runs after desires — cannot be at peace, because every satisfied desire only reveals another. But the ocean-like sage is already full. He has nothing to seek.","sarvapriyananda":"The ocean simile is one of the most magnificent in all of Sanskrit literature, and its theological depth is extraordinary. Notice that Krishna does not describe a sage from whom desires are absent — he describes one into whom all desires (sarve kāmāḥ) enter (praviśanti). The sage is not desire-less in the sense of being a dry, affectless being. He is desire-less in the sense of being so completely full — āpūryamāṇam — that nothing can overflow him, nothing can displace him from his center. From a Vedantic standpoint, this fullness is the natural condition of the Ātman, which is pūrṇa — infinite and complete. The sage who has realized the Ātman simply is that ocean. Desires arise in the mind — as rivers must flow — but they do not touch the Self. 'Acala-pratiṣṭham' — his foundation is unmoving. The kāma-kāmī, by contrast, is like a small pond that overflows with every new stream and dries up with every drought.","yogananda":"Yogananda considers this one of the most practically instructive verses for the meditator. He points out that the ocean is not empty — it is 'āpūryamāṇam,' continually being filled, ever-full. The sage is not a void but a being filled with divine bliss — ānanda. Because he is already full of the joy of God, the pleasures and enticements of the world flow into his awareness and are absorbed without creating ripples. Yogananda taught that this is the actual experience of advanced meditation: when the soul is brimful with inner divine joy, sense pleasures simply lose their drawing power — not because of willpower or suppression, but because a greater, more satisfying fullness already exists within. The kāma-kāmī runs after desires precisely because he is inwardly empty, perpetually thirsting. The yogī, full with God-contact, is the ocean that the rivers of desire cannot disturb.","goyandka":"Goyandaka explains that the verse contains a crucial distinction: 'kāmāḥ praviśanti' — desires enter — versus 'kāma-kāmī' — the one who actively pursues desires. The wise person cannot prevent desires from arising in the mind; the impressions (saṃskāras) and the contact of senses with objects will produce mental movements. But there is a fundamental difference between thoughts of desire arising and the person rushing after them. The ocean does not chase the rivers; the rivers come to it. Similarly, the sthita-prajña does not pursue desires; if they arise, they dissolve in the vast fullness of his equanimity without producing agitation. 'Na kāma-kāmī' — not the one who hankers after desires — is the pointed conclusion: chasing desires cannot bring peace because the very act of chasing presupposes and perpetuates a sense of lack."}},{"verse":71,"sanskrit":"विहाय कामान्यः सर्वान्पुमांश्चरति निःस्पृहः ।\\nनिर्ममो निरहङ्कारः स शान्तिमधिगच्छति ॥","transliteration":"vihāya kāmān yaḥ sarvān pumāṃś carati niḥspṛhaḥ\\nnirmamo nirahaṃkāraḥ sa śāntim adhigacchati","translation":"The man who abandons all desires and moves about without longing, without the sense of mine, and without ego — he attains peace.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch02/verse_02_71.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"विहाय","transliteration":"vihāya","root":"vi + √hā (to abandon, to leave behind)","grammatical_form":"Indeclinable past participle (gerund)","meaning":"having abandoned / having cast aside / relinquishing"},{"word":"निःस्पृहः","transliteration":"niḥspṛhaḥ","root":"nis (without) + spṛhā (longing, craving)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"free from longing / without craving / desireless"},{"word":"निर्ममः","transliteration":"nirmamaḥ","root":"nis (without) + mama (mine, of me)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"without sense of mine / free from possessiveness"},{"word":"निरहङ्कारः","transliteration":"nirahaṃkāraḥ","root":"nis (without) + ahaṃkāra (I-making, ego-sense)","grammatical_form":"Adjective, masculine, nominative singular","meaning":"without ego / free from the I-making faculty"},{"word":"अधिगच्छति","transliteration":"adhigacchati","root":"adhi + √gam (to go, to attain)","grammatical_form":"Verb, 3rd person singular, present tense","meaning":"attains / reaches / arrives at"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Dadaji said that this verse gives us three keys, and all three doors must be opened together: no longing (niḥspṛha), no sense of mine (nirmama), and no ego (nirahaṃkāra). He explained it like this: spṛhā is the reaching toward — the heart stretching out for something it does not yet have. Mamata is the clutching — this is mine, I must keep it. And ahaṃkāra is the one who is doing both the reaching and the clutching: the false 'I,' the small self that has claimed a life, a body, relationships, and achievements as its own. When all three fall away — not by force but by genuine understanding — what remains? The self that was never bound. The peace (śānti) that was always there beneath the noise. Dadaji used to say: 'We do not attain peace. We simply stop disturbing it.'","sarvapriyananda":"This verse gives the complete portrait of the liberated being in purely negative terms — not as a description of what the sage possesses, but of what he has shed. 'Vihāya kāmān sarvān' — having abandoned all desires — is not the suppression of desires but their natural falling away when the Self is known. Vedanta explains: desires arise because we believe we lack something. When the Ātman — which is pūrṇa, infinite fullness — is realized, lack becomes impossible, and desire has no foothold. 'Nirmama' — without mine — addresses the possessive superimposition: the ego's tendency to extend itself into objects and relationships and claim them as 'mine.' 'Nirahaṃkāra' is the deepest: the ahaṃkāra itself — the 'I am this body-mind' identification — is dissolved. Without these three false constructs, the natural peace of the Self, which was always present but obscured, stands revealed.","yogananda":"Yogananda points out that the sequence in this verse is instructive. 'Vihāya' — having abandoned — comes first, indicating an act of inner renunciation. But this is not the grim self-denial of the ascetic; it is the natural release that occurs when one has found something infinitely more satisfying within. When divine bliss is contacted in meditation, desires are not suppressed — they are outgrown. 'Niḥspṛhaḥ' — without longing — describes the heart that has drunk so deeply from the inner wellspring of ānanda that it has lost its thirst for outer stimulation. 'Nirmama' and 'nirahaṃkāra' describe the progressive dissolution of the ego's two most fundamental operations: claiming (this is mine) and being (I am this). When both operations cease, what Yogananda called the soul's innate peace — ever-existing, ever-conscious, ever-new bliss — stands alone.","goyandka":"Goyandaka comments that this verse is the most concise positive prescription for liberation in the chapter thus far. 'Vihāya kāmān sarvān' — all desires without exception, not merely gross desires but subtle ones too, including the desire for liberation if it carries the flavor of ego-motivated seeking. The three qualifiers — niḥspṛha, nirmama, nirahaṃkāra — represent the threefold dissolution of the ego's architecture: its craving (spṛhā), its possessiveness (mamata), and its very existence as a separate self (ahaṃkāra). Goyandaka notes that these are not three separate practices but three aspects of one inner transformation. When through sādhanā the ego's hold weakens — through devotion, discrimination, and surrender — all three fall away together, and śānti, the peace of the Self, is naturally adhigacchati, attained. This verse bridges the description of the sage's peace (verse 70) with the supreme declaration of verse 72."}},{"verse":72,"sanskrit":"एषा ब्राह्मी स्थितिः पार्थ नैनां प्राप्य विमुह्यति ।\\nस्थित्वास्यामन्तकालेऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छति ॥","transliteration":"eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha naināṃ prāpya vimuhyati\\nsthitvāsyām anta-kāle 'pi brahma-nirvāṇam ṛcchati","translation":"This, O Partha, is the brahmi-sthiti — the state established in Brahman.

He called it 'the seal of the Gita's second chapter — and the seal is made of pure gold.' From verse 11, where Krishna began His teaching with 'the wise grieve not for the living or the dead,' all the way through the ocean-like sage, the night-and-day vision, the three inner freedoms — it all culminates here. Eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ: THIS is it. This is the state established in Brahman that all the teaching has been pointing toward. And two promises are sealed in it. First: naināṃ prāpya vimuhyati — having reached it, you will not be deluded again. Not confused, not lost, not tossed by grief and fear as Arjuna was at the chapter's opening. And second — the supreme gift — even if you only reach this state at the very moment of death, you attain brahma-nirvāṇa: the final merging, the homecoming that knows no return to sorrow. 'It is all right,' Dadaji used to say. 'Even at the last breath — if this state is touched — everything is all right.'","sarvapriyananda":"With 'eṣā brāhmī sthitiḥ,' the second chapter of the Gita closes in the most complete way possible. 'This' — eṣā — refers to everything described in the preceding verses: the state of the sthita-prajña, the ocean-like equanimity, the withdrawal of the senses, the abandonment of ego and possessiveness, the wakefulness in the night of the Self. All of it together constitutes the brāhmī sthiti — the state of abidance in Brahman. The word 'sthiti' is crucial: it is not a temporary experience but a stable establishment, a permanent dwelling. The Vedantic reading is profound: this verse does not promise the future attainment of something not yet present. It reveals that Brahman — one's own true nature — was always the case; the brāhmī sthiti is the recognition of what eternally is. 'Naināṃ prāpya vimuhyati' — once this recognition is firm, delusion cannot return. And 'brahma-nirvāṇam' — Brahman-extinction — is not annihilation but the extinguishing of the false self in the fire of the true Self: the drop recognizing itself as the ocean.","yogananda":"Yogananda calls this verse the 'victory proclamation' of the second chapter and meditates on it as containing the entire teaching of the Gita in seed form. 'Brāhmī sthitiḥ' — established in Brahman — is the state Yogananda described as the final goal of all his spiritual teaching: the continuous, unbroken awareness of one's identity with the Divine, not merely in peak meditation experiences but as a stable condition of daily consciousness. 'Naināṃ prāpya vimuhyati' carries immense significance for Yogananda: he taught that the greatest terror of human life is the fear of death and the fear of meaninglessness — both are expressions of moha, delusion. The sage in brāhmī sthiti is immune to both. He has seen through the illusion of separateness, and death — which is merely the dissolution of the temporary body — holds no sting. Most beautifully, 'anta-kāle 'pi' — even at the time of death — affirms that it is never too late. Even the dying person who in their final moment achieves this inner establishment is liberated completely. This is the Gita's supreme mercy, sealed at the close of its second chapter.","goyandka":"Goyandaka regards this final verse as the crown jewel of the Gita's second chapter and one of the most important individual verses in the entire scripture. 'Eṣā' — this — looks backward across the entire teaching from verse 55 onward: the portrait of the sthita-prajña, his equanimity in pleasure and pain, his tortoise-like withdrawal of the senses, his non-attachment, his ocean-like fullness, his inversion of the world's waking and sleeping. All of this constitutes the brāhmī sthiti. Goyandaka notes that 'naināṃ prāpya vimuhyati' is absolute and unqualified: upon reaching this state, delusion does not merely diminish — it ceases. The Gita's first chapter opened with Arjuna's total delusion (viṣāda); this verse closes Chapter 2 by announcing that delusion can be permanently ended. And the final phrase — 'brahma-nirvāṇam ṛcchati' — is the ultimate promise of the Gita: liberation, mokṣa, the absorption of the individual self into the infinite Brahman. Goyandaka emphasizes that 'anta-kāle 'pi' — even at the moment of death — shows the infinite grace of the teaching: no spiritual work is wasted, and even a deathbed establishment in this state is sufficient for the final liberation. This verse is both the conclusion of Sāṃkhya Yoga and the seed of all that follows in the remaining sixteen chapters."}}]`),t={chapter:2,verses:e};export{a as chapter,t as default,e as verses};
