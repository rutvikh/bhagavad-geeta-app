        "dadaji": "Bhishma's lone lion-roar has now triggered an avalanche of sound — conches, kettledrums, tabors, drums, cow-horns, all erupting at once. The Kaurava side answers its commander's signal with full-throated enthusiasm. Dadaji often reflected on how quickly the momentum of conflict builds: one action, one declaration, and suddenly the entire force of accumulated hostility is unleashed. The Sanskrit word 'sahasā' — suddenly, all at once — captures this irreversibility. Once certain moments are set in motion, they cannot be recalled. This is why the Geeta begins not in a palace or a forest but here — at this point of no return — because only at this threshold does the urgency of spiritual wisdom become undeniable.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The multiplicity of instruments enumerated — śaṅkhāḥ, bheryaḥ, paṇava, ānaka, go-mukha — represents the cacophony of the restless mind that is not yet stilled by meditation or wisdom. Each instrument is a different voice of distraction, desire, or fear. The resulting 'tumula śabda' — tumultuous sound — is the condition of the ordinary unexamined mind: a roar of competing impulses with no single organizing clarity. Against this background of noise, Krishna will soon speak. The teaching of the Geeta is, in one sense, the voice of wisdom rising above the battlefield's deafening din — the still small voice that reaches those who are ready to hear beneath all the tumult.",
        "yogananda": "The sudden simultaneous sounding of all instruments — 'sahasaiva abhyahanyanta' — represents the moment when the ego's forces mobilize completely. In the inner war, this is the experience of the aspirant who, having made the first decisive commitment to the spiritual path, suddenly finds that all the forces of habit, desire, and distraction rise up simultaneously. It can feel overwhelming. Yogananda reassured his students that this eruption of opposition is itself a sign of progress: the ego only marshals its full army when it senses a genuine threat to its dominion. The 'tumula śabda' — this deafening inner noise — is the darkness before the dawn of inner silence.",
        "goyandka": "This verse describes the sonic response of the Kaurava forces to Bhishma's signal. The five instruments named cover the full spectrum of ancient Indian martial music: śaṅkha (conch, blown wind instrument), bherī (large kettledrum struck with sticks), paṇava (small tabor worn around the neck), ānaka (a large war drum played in pairs), and go-mukha (literally 'cow-mouthed,' a large horn or bugle). Together they represent the full orchestration of a Vedic army's battle preparations. The use of the imperfect passive 'abhyahanyanta' suggests that the sounding was not commanded by anyone specifically — it arose spontaneously from every direction at once, creating the 'tumula śabda,' the tremendous uproar."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "The shift from the Kaurava instruments to Krishna and Arjuna is dramatic and deliberate. On one side: a cacophony of military drums and horns signaling fear and aggression. On the other: two figures stationed on a magnificent chariot, white horses gleaming, blowing divine conches. Dadaji always pointed to the white horses as symbolic of purity — Krishna chooses to guide a chariot of pure intention. The word 'divyau' — divine — distinguishes these conches from ordinary military instruments. They are not simply war trumpets; they carry a sacred vibration. Where Bhishma's conch responded to Duryodhana's anxiety, Krishna and Arjuna's conches announce the presence of dharma.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The epithet 'Mādhava' — used here for the first time in the Geeta — is significant. Mādhava derives from 'Madhu,' one of the Yadu ancestors, but is also interpreted as 'lord of Mā (Lakshmi)' — the lord of divine prosperity and grace. Sanjaya names Krishna first, before Arjuna, even though Arjuna is the protagonist. This signals the Geeta's ultimate teaching: the Divine comes first; the individual devotee acts in response to the Divine, not the reverse. The white horses symbolize the pure sāttvic qualities that draw the chariot of spiritual life — the mind purified, refined, capable of bearing the weight of divine instruction.",
        "yogananda": "The great chariot yoked with white horses — śvetair hayair yukte — is one of the most vivid images in all sacred literature. Yogananda saw in it an exact representation of the spiritual anatomy: the chariot is the body, the white horses are the purified life-forces, and stationed within are the individual soul (Arjuna) and the divine Presence (Krishna). The blowing of the divine conches represents the moment the aspiring soul, guided by the inner divine consciousness, announces its readiness to engage the ultimate battle: the battle for liberation. These are not ordinary shells; they carry the primordial sound — Oṃ, the seed of all creation.",
        "goyandka": "This verse introduces a shift in perspective: after describing the Kaurava tumult, Sanjaya now focuses on the Pandava side's most important occupants — Krishna and Arjuna together in their chariot. The chariot is described as 'mahati' (magnificent, great) and 'yukte śvetair hayaiḥ' — yoked with white horses. The white horses were a gift of the gods; they belonged to Arjuna and were called Śaivya, Sugrīva, Meghapuṣpa, and Balāhaka in various accounts. The dual verb 'pradadhmatuḥ' emphasizes that both act simultaneously. The word 'pra' in the prefix intensifies the action — they blew forth with full power."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "Each conch has a name, and each name carries a history and a teaching. Pāñcajanya — Krishna's conch — was retrieved from the depths of the ocean after slaying the demon who had kidnapped Sandipani Muni's son. It is a conch born of conquest over darkness. Devadatta — 'given by the gods' — was Arjuna's divine gift. Pauṇḍra, Bhima's mighty conch, matches his thunderous nature. Dadaji loved how the Geeta introduces each warrior through his instrument: the conch is the voice of the warrior's soul, his unique frequency in the symphony of dharma. Krishna's epithet here — Hṛṣīkeśa, Lord of the senses — is profoundly meaningful: the one who controls the senses is the one who blows the first divine note.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The epithet 'Hṛṣīkeśa' — Lord of the senses — is of special importance in Vedantic study of the Geeta. Arjuna will later use this same name when asking Krishna to position the chariot between the armies. It signals that Krishna is the master of all sensory experience, not its slave. The one who leads the Pandava cause and guides the divine chariot is precisely the one who has transcended sensory bondage. This is Vedanta's central prescription: establish yourself as the witness-consciousness that governs the senses rather than being driven by them. Hṛṣīkeśa does not merely fight in this war — He orchestrates it from the level of supreme Self-mastery.",
        "yogananda": "The three conches sounding here — Pāñcajanya, Devadatta, and Pauṇḍra — represent the three principal levels of spiritual calling. Pāñcajanya, retrieved from the depths of the ocean after defeating a demon, represents the calling that emerges from the deepest inner transformation, from victory over the unconscious. Devadatta — given by the gods — represents the calling that is a divine gift, bestowed through grace. Pauṇḍra — mighty, earth-shaking — represents the calling of sheer spiritual will and vital force. Together they announce that the dharmic battle is engaged on all three levels: the depths of the unconscious, the heights of divine grace, and the full force of awakened will.",
        "goyandka": "The three conches named here are among the most famous objects in the Mahābhārata. Pāñcajanya was obtained by Krishna when he slew the demon Pañcajana (or Śaṅkhāsura) who lived in the sea; it is made from that demon's bones. Devadatta was gifted to Arjuna by Varuṇa, the god of waters, when Arjuna won the divine bow Gāṇḍīva. Pauṇḍra (also called Vaiṣṇava) was Bhīma's, known for its tremendous volume. The epithets used are precise: Arjuna as 'Dhanañjaya' (one who won wealth during the Rājasūya sacrifice), Bhīma as 'bhīma-karmā' (doer of terrible deeds) and 'vṛkodara' (wolf-bellied, for his insatiable strength and appetite)."

This is not the boastful claim of a warrior; it is the quiet certainty of one who has lived his entire life in truth. Dadaji saw in this conch-name a profound assurance: the path of righteousness may be difficult, it may pass through exile and humiliation and grief, but its final victory is endless and unassailable. Truth cannot ultimately be defeated. The other Pandavas' conches — Sughosha (sweet-sounding) for the handsome, graceful Nakula; Maṇipuṣpaka (jewel-flowered) for the wise Sahadeva — each reflects the character of its owner.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Yudhishthira is identified here with two designations: 'rājā' (king) and 'kuntī-putraḥ' (son of Kunti). The first establishes his worldly authority; the second, his lineage of devotion. Kunti is one of the great devotees in the epic, whose entire life was shaped by her faith and surrender to the divine. Yudhishthira inherits both the scepter of dharma and the heart of devotion from his mother. In Vedanta, the 'endless victory' — anantavijaya — is the only true victory: the victory of the Self over the illusion of separation. All other victories are temporary. Only the recognition of the infinite Ātman constitutes ananta-vijaya.",
        "yogananda": "The five Pandava brothers and their respective conches form a complete quintet of spiritual faculties. Yudhishthira — the dharmic will — blows 'Anantavijaya,' endless victory, because the force of dharma, properly understood, can never be finally defeated. Nakula's 'Sughoṣa' — beautiful sound — represents the power of harmonious aesthetic perception aligned with the Divine. Sahadeva's 'Maṇipuṣpaka' — jewel and flower — represents the faculty of wisdom and discrimination (Sahadeva was the most learned of the Pandavas in the sacred sciences). Together, these five instruments create a complete sacred symphony of the soul's forces declaring readiness.",
        "goyandka": "This verse continues the enumeration of Pandava conches, now listing the remaining three brothers. 'Anantavijaya' — eternal/endless victory — is aptly named for Yudhishthira, since victory for him is not merely military but dharmic: the establishment of eternal right order. Nakula and Sahadeva are mentioned together with their conches given in the dual form — a grammatical elegance that reflects their closeness as the youngest pair, born of Mādrī (Pāṇḍu's second wife). The naming of conches was not mere convention; each conch was considered a living presence with its own power and resonance. The enumeration of five Pandava conches against the one Kaurava conch (Bhishma's) emphasizes the spiritual richness of the Pandava side."

Dadaji saw in Śikhaṇḍī's presence on the battlefield a reminder that the consequences of our actions toward others do not simply dissolve; they take form, they return, they find their resolution. Bhishma, the most invincible warrior alive, would fall not to any military power but to the karmic force embodied in Śikhaṇḍī. This is the Geeta's background teaching: no one escapes the law of karma, however powerful they may be.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Sātyaki — described here as 'aparājita,' the unconquered — was Krishna's beloved disciple and the most loyal of Arjuna's companions in battle. His epithet 'unconquered' is worth reflecting upon from a Vedantic perspective: the truly unconquered is not the warrior who has never lost a physical battle, but the one who has conquered the internal enemies of desire, anger, and ego. The external invincibility of these warriors is a shadow of the inner invincibility that comes from established Self-knowledge. The Geeta will eventually teach that the one truly 'aparājita' — never conquered — is the Ātman itself, beyond birth, death, sword and spear.",
        "yogananda": "These warriors — Kāśya, Śikhaṇḍī, Dhṛṣṭadyumna, Virāṭa, Sātyaki — represent specific qualities of the spiritually aligned psyche arrayed for battle. The king of Kāśī (Varanasi, city of light and liberation) represents the power of sacred knowledge deployed in action. Śikhaṇḍī, who transcended gender and was reborn for a specific dharmic purpose, represents the power of resolute divine intention that persists across multiple lifetimes.

The king of Kāśī is unnamed but identified by his title and quality: 'parameṣvāsaḥ' — supreme archer. Śikhaṇḍī's story is one of the most extraordinary in the epic: born as Ambā, rejected by Bhishma and unable to marry, she performed penances, was granted a boon to become male in a future birth, was reborn as Śikhaṇḍī, and ultimately served as the instrument of Bhishma's death. Dhṛṣṭadyumna was born from the sacred fire specifically to kill Droṇa. Sātyaki (also known as Yuyudhāna) was a Yādava hero and Arjuna's student in archery."

Dadaji saw in this a lesson about unity in diversity: dharma does not flatten individuals into a uniform force. Each soul has its own note, its own frequency, its own unique contribution to the symphony of righteousness. Abhimanyu — the young, the brilliant, the doomed — sounds his conch here among the greatest warriors. His 'mahā-bāhu' (mighty-armed) epithet signals his power even as the reader who knows the story must feel a pang: this young hero will not survive the war.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Sanjaya addresses Dhritarashtra as 'pṛthivī-pate' — lord of the earth. The irony is sharp: Dhritarashtra, the blind king who holds earthly dominion, cannot see the battlefield he supposedly rules. He depends entirely on Sanjaya's divine vision to witness events. From the Vedantic standpoint, Dhritarashtra is the perfect symbol of avidyā — ignorance — that presides over the realm of the senses (his kingdom) while being constitutionally unable to perceive the real. The blind king is not merely physically blind; he is unable to see the dharmic truth that his attachment to his son has created this catastrophe.",
        "yogananda": "Abhimanyu — the son of Arjuna and Subhadrā, nephew of Krishna — was said to have learned the knowledge of how to enter the seven-layered chakravyūha formation while still in his mother's womb, but the knowledge of how to exit was never completed because Subhadrā fell asleep before Arjuna could finish telling her. This detail — so famous in the Mahabharata — has profound metaphysical resonance. The soul enters the chakravyūha of embodied life with partial knowledge; it must complete that knowledge through lived experience, through the spiritual battle itself. Abhimanyu's eventual entrapment mirrors the aspirant who enters the battle for liberation armed with great capacity but incomplete knowledge.",
        "goyandka": "This verse concludes the enumeration of the Pandava conch-blowers begun in verse 15. 'Sarvaśaḥ' — all of them, every single one — means that the enumeration is now complete; no Pandava commander has been left out. The address 'pṛthivī-pate' to Dhritarashtra is one of several such addresses by Sanjaya throughout the first chapter (others include 'Bhārata,' 'rājan,' etc.), each subtly reminding the blind king that the events being described are the direct consequence of his own failures of governance and justice. 'Pṛthak pṛthak' — each separately — linguistically reinforces what the enumeration demonstrates: the Pandava side has a rich individuality of heroic voices, while the Kaurava side had only one conch explicitly named (Bhishma's)."

        "dadaji": "The sound of the Pandava conches — divine, pure, righteous — literally split the hearts of the Kauravas. Not their bodies: their hearts. Dadaji observed that the sound of dharma is terrifying to those who have chosen adharma. It is not an external weapon that strikes them; it is something within themselves — their own conscience — that responds to the vibration of truth with anguish. The sons of Dhritarashtra knew, in their hearts, that they were wrong. The divine conches gave voice to what they could not silence: the inner knowledge of their own unrighteousness. This is why the sound 'rends the hearts' rather than merely frightening the bodies.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The verse draws a stark contrast: the Kaurava drums filled the sky with noise and bravado; the Pandava conches filled the sky and earth with a sound that 'rent asunder the hearts' of the enemy. This is the power of alignment with truth. A force grounded in dharma does not merely match the power of adharma — it strikes at a deeper level. From the Vedantic perspective, the 'hṛdaya' — the heart — is the seat of consciousness, the cave of the Ātman. When truth sounds its note, it reverberates into that cave and disturbs the false self that has made its home there. The Kauravas are undone not by superior weapons but by the resonance of righteousness.",
        "yogananda": "The divine sound — 'sa ghoṣaḥ' — that fills heaven and earth and rends the hearts of the Kauravas is symbolically the primal sound of Oṃ, the cosmic vibration that underlies all creation. When the soul, guided by the Divine, sounds its authentic note, it has the power to shake the foundations of the ego's kingdom. Yogananda taught that the practice of Oṃ meditation — listening to and merging with the cosmic sound — is itself a preparation for the inner war. The ego cannot stand against the resonance of Oṃ. It 'vyadārayat' — cracks open — in the presence of the primal divine vibration, and in that opening, the light of Self-knowledge begins to enter.",
        "goyandka": "This verse provides the narrative result of the Pandava conch-sounding: the uproar was so immense that it filled 'nabhaś ca pṛthivīṃ ca' — heaven and earth alike — and its effect was specific: it 'vyadārayat hṛdayāni dhārtarāṣṭrāṇām' — it rent asunder the hearts of the Dhārtarāṣṭras. Classical commentators note that this effect is not physical but psychological: the Kaurava army, upon hearing the disciplined and powerful response of the Pandava side, felt demoralization at the deepest level. The word 'vyadārayat' (from vi + √dṝ) conveys a complete splitting — not a crack but a rupture. This moment signals that before a single arrow is fired, the psychological advantage has already shifted to the Pandava side."

Dadaji always emphasized that this moment of pause — of 'dṛṣṭvā,' of seeing before acting — is the moment of conscience. Most people in Arjuna's position, trained warriors with dharmic cause and divine backing, would fire immediately. Arjuna pauses. He looks. And what he is about to see will change everything. The emblem on his flag — Hanuman, the supreme devotee — is profoundly significant. Hanuman reminds us that the greatest strength is not military power but devotion: the capacity to serve the divine will rather than one's own ego. Arjuna's banner carries this message even as his hands prepare for war.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The epithet 'kapi-dhvajaḥ' — he whose banner bears the monkey, i.e., Hanuman — is theologically rich. Hanuman, the divine servant, is the embodiment of Bhakti (devotion) and Karma Yoga (selfless service). His presence on Arjuna's banner declares the spirit in which the warrior fights: not for personal glory but as an instrument of the divine. This is the secret teaching embedded in a single compound word. Before the famous dialogue of the Geeta begins, before Arjuna's crisis, before Krishna's teaching — the answer is already there on Arjuna's flag: act as Hanuman acted, in total surrender to the Divine, and the battle becomes worship.",
        "yogananda": "Hanuman on Arjuna's flag is not accidental. When Arjuna encountered Hanuman during the Mahabharata narrative, Hanuman promised to sit on his chariot flag and give him strength and protection. Yogananda saw in this a profound metaphysical truth: when the individual soul (Arjuna) invites the devotee-consciousness — the consciousness that is fully surrendered to God — it gains a protector and a power that no enemy can overcome. 'Kapi-dhvaja' — the banner of the devoted servant — is the consciousness that Arjuna carries into battle. It is the consciousness the Geeta will ultimately call him to inhabit fully: Naiṣkarmya Karma Yoga, action performed without ego, in total offering.",
        "goyandka": "This verse marks the crucial narrative pivot: Arjuna, positioned in the chariot, sees the Kaurava army arrayed for battle and raises his bow. The locative absolute 'pravṛtte śastra-sampāte' — when the weapons were about to fly — establishes the urgency: this is the last possible moment before battle is joined. Arjuna's epithet 'kapi-dhvaja' refers to the boon obtained from Hanuman, who blessed Arjuna and promised to dwell on his battle standard, multiplying his chariot's power and filling the enemy with dread. 'Dhanur udyamya' — having raised the bow — is the action that precedes the sudden crisis: Arjuna lifts Gāṇḍīva but what he sees next will cause his arms to tremble and his bow to slip."

        "dadaji": "Here Arjuna speaks for the first time in the Geeta, and his first act is to ask Krishna to place the chariot in the middle — between the two sides. This is a gesture of profound significance: he wants to see both. He wants to be centered. Dadaji saw this as Arjuna's dharmic instinct asserting itself even before his great crisis: he is not simply charging forward; he pauses to witness fully. He addresses Krishna as 'Acyuta' — the Infallible, the One who never slips. This name, chosen consciously or unconsciously, is the voice of trust: 'You who never slip, guide me.' Every true devotee, at the threshold of life's greatest battles, turns to the Divine and makes this same request.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Arjuna's request to be placed in the center — 'senayor ubhayor madhye' — between both armies — is symbolically the request of every sincere seeker: place me at the point of maximum clarity, where I can see the full truth. The middle position is the witness position — the place of the sākṣī, the observer, who is neither wholly absorbed in one side nor the other. It is also, profoundly, the position from which the truth becomes unbearable and wisdom becomes necessary. Arjuna asks to see 'yoddhu-kāmān' — those eager to fight. He wants to understand the nature of his opponents. This seeing will be the genesis of his crisis — and ultimately of his liberation.",
        "yogananda": "The name 'Acyuta' — the Infallible — is Arjuna's first words to Krishna in the Geeta. Yogananda observed that this name reveals the spiritual relationship between them: Arjuna knows, intuitively, that Krishna will not lead him astray. He may not yet understand everything Krishna will teach, but he trusts utterly. This trust — the capacity to say 'Acyuta, place me where I need to be' — is the beginning of discipleship. The disciple who says to the guru, 'position me correctly, I will look at what you show me' — even if what they see will shatter them — has taken the first step on the path that ends in liberation. Arjuna's request is a model of perfect surrender.",
        "goyandka": "With 'arjuna uvāca' — Arjuna spoke — the Geeta's central voice enters for the first time. Verses 21–22 form a single complete statement of request; they are sometimes read as one unit (21–23 in some recensions). Arjuna asks Krishna — here called 'Acyuta' (the Infallible, one of the 108 names of Viṣṇu) — to place the chariot 'senayor ubhayor madhye' — in the middle space between both armies. The purpose is explicitly stated: 'yāvad etān nirīkṣe' — so that I may thoroughly survey — specifically 'yoddhu-kāmān avasthitān' — those who stand there eager to fight. This is a military commander's reconnaissance, but it will immediately transform into a profound spiritual crisis."

He has no illusions about who Duryodhana is or what this war is about. And yet — in just a few verses — when he actually sees who these people are, his moral clarity will collapse into grief. This is the human condition: we can state the right principle clearly in the abstract, but when the faces of loved ones fill the field, principle meets feeling and the battle within begins. The Geeta's genius is that it does not skip this collapse; it enters it fully, and shows us the way through.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The word 'durbuddheḥ' — of the evil-minded one — is Arjuna's own judgment of Duryodhana, spoken before the famous crisis of compassion. He knows who the enemy is. He knows who is responsible for this war. Yet Advaita Vedanta teaches that knowing the situation clearly at the level of the intellect is not the same as being free from attachment. One can correctly assess a situation — 'this is adharma, that is the cause, these are the consequences' — and still be unable to act freely, because the heart remains bound by love, by memory, by the unbearable reality of kinship. The Geeta takes Arjuna from correct intellectual assessment through the furnace of grief to the freedom of realized Self-knowledge.",
        "yogananda": "The desiderative compound 'priya-cikīrṣavaḥ' — those who are eager to please, who desire to gratify — is a profound characterization. Those who have gathered on the Kaurava side are not simply warriors: they are servants of desire, men whose actions are oriented toward pleasing a worldly master rather than serving dharma or the Divine. Yogananda saw in this the definition of samsāric action: acting to please the ego (personal or another's) rather than acting in alignment with one's divine nature. The entire teaching of the Geeta aims to shift Arjuna — and through him, every reader — from 'priya-cikīrṣu' (one who acts to please) to 'nimitta-mātra' (an instrument of the Divine).",
        "goyandka": "This verse completes Arjuna's two-verse request (verses 21–22) to Krishna. The request is specific: he wants to see 'yotsyamānān' — those who are about to fight — particularly those gathered to do what is dear to 'dhārtarāṣṭrasya durbuddheḥ' — Duryodhana, characterized directly as 'evil-minded.' The compound 'priya-cikīrṣavaḥ' uses the desiderative form of √kṛ — they are not merely acting but are eager, desirous to please. This characterizes the Kaurava allies as followers of personal loyalty rather than of principle. The stage is now perfectly set: the chariot will be placed in the center, Arjuna will look, and the great crisis of the Geeta will begin."
