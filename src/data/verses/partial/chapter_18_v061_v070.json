        "dadaji": "This verse reveals the most intimate secret of existence: the Lord is not distant in some heaven but seated in the very heart of every creature. Arjuna himself, torn by grief and confusion, has the Supreme Ruler abiding within him at this very moment of crisis. The image of yantrārūḍhāni — beings mounted on a machine — strips away the illusion that we are the ultimate authors of our lives. Just as a machine moves only when powered by an external force, every being acts because the Inner Controller (Antaryāmin) wills it so. To know this is not fatalism but freedom: stop imagining you are the machine's master, and rest in the One who truly is.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Śaṅkara comments that this verse establishes the Lord as Antaryāmin — the Inner Ruler described in the Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad: 'He who dwells in all beings, yet is other than all beings, whom no being knows, whose body all beings are, who controls all beings from within — He is your ātman, the Inner Controller, the Immortal.' The yantra (machine) is the body-mind complex; māyā is the divine energy that sets it in motion. Crucially, the Jīva (individual soul) mistakes itself for the machine's driver, when in truth it is itself carried along. Vedānta's liberating insight is precisely this recognition: the Sākṣī (witness) within is not the doer — it is the eternal Lord.",
        "yogananda": "God is not to be sought in distant temples or on mountain peaks — He is the Life of your life, the innermost Presence animating every heartbeat and thought. This verse is science and mysticism united: the heart center (hṛd-deśa) is not merely the physical organ but the spiritual seat where individual consciousness touches the Infinite. In deep meditation, the devotee discovers this Presence — first as peace, then as light, then as the living God whose joy is the very substance of one's being. The 'machine' analogy should humble and liberate us simultaneously: humbled because we are not the source of our own life; liberated because the Source that moves us is the all-loving Lord Himself.",
        "goyandka": "The Lord here teaches the doctrine of the Antaryāmin with crystalline precision. He — the very Bhagavān who speaks to Arjuna — simultaneously abides within Arjuna's own heart. This is the paradox of the avatāra teaching: the Lord stands before Arjuna externally as the charioteer, and internally as the Antaryāmin. 'Yantrārūḍhāni' signifies that bodies are instruments (yantra) created by prakṛti; the jīva, identified with the body by māyā, believes itself to be the agent. The remedy is the surrender taught in the next verse. Understanding that the Lord is the real mover dissolves ahaṃkāra (ego-sense of doership) and opens the door to liberation."

        "dadaji": "Having revealed the Antaryāmin in the previous verse, the Lord now issues the most natural and loving counsel: turn toward the One who already lives within you. 'Tam eva' — Him alone, not alongside other refuges but exclusively. 'Sarva-bhāvena' is the key — not a portion of yourself but your entire being: intellect, emotion, will, memory, body. Half-surrender produces half-peace. Total surrender produces the parāṃ śāntim — a peace that has no opposite, that no circumstance can disturb. The 'eternal abode' (sthānam śāśvatam) is not a place in space but a condition of being — the natural state of the soul reunited with its Source.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse is the practical complement to verse 61. Verse 61 says: the Lord moves all beings by māyā. Verse 62 says: therefore, surrender to that Lord and be moved by grace rather than by māyā. The difference between samsāra and mokṣa is precisely this: in samsāra, the Lord's māyā causes the jīva to revolve in ignorance; in surrender, that same Lord's prasāda (grace) carries the devotee to liberation. 'Tat-prasādāt' — grace alone accomplishes what no amount of self-effort can ultimately achieve, for it is the grace of the very power that sustains all existence. Śaraṇāgati (complete surrender) is thus the highest sādhana.",
        "yogananda": "True refuge means resting in God so completely that one's own anxious self-management ceases. Most spiritual seekers take partial refuge — they pray, then worry; they meditate, then scheme. 'Sarva-bhāvena' dissolves this division: every mood, every desire, every fear is handed over to the Lord of the Heart. In that total offering, the divine grace flows unobstructed like sunlight through a cleared sky. The 'supreme peace' Kṛṣṇa promises is not the peace of resolution of worldly problems — it is the peace that IS God's own nature, experienced directly when the soul stops fighting its own Source.",
        "goyandka": "The sequence of verses 61-62 forms a perfect teaching unit. First, understand that the Lord is your inner mover (v61); then, knowing this, consciously take refuge in that mover (v62). This is the essence of prapatti or śaraṇāgati — the path of complete self-surrender as taught in the Vaiṣṇava tradition and implicit throughout the Gita. 'Prasāda' literally means grace, the Lord's uncaused, unconditional favor. The result — parāṃ śāntim sthānaṃ śāśvatam — combines peace of mind (śānti) and the eternal state of liberation (śāśvata-sthāna). Both are gifts of grace, not achievements of effort."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "After eighteen chapters — the most comprehensive spiritual dialogue ever recorded — Kṛṣṇa steps back and gives Arjuna the greatest gift a teacher can give a student: his freedom. 'Do as you wish.' There is no coercion in the Lord's teaching. He has illuminated every path, answered every question, shared His innermost nature — and now He waits. 'Vimṛśya aśeṣeṇa' — reflect without remainder, let the teaching penetrate every corner of your being. Only then act. This is the highest respect for human dignity: the Lord will not override the free will He Himself has given. The choice to awaken must always be the soul's own.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Śaṅkara notes that 'guhyād guhyataram' echoes Chapter 9's 'rāja-vidyā rāja-guhyam' (the royal knowledge, royal secret), but here the teaching is declared even more secret. What makes it most secret is not its complexity but its intimacy — it speaks of the Lord's own nature and His direct relationship with the devotee. 'Yathecchasi tathā kuru' is philosophically significant: the Lord's teaching preserves free will. The Gita is not a fatalistic text. Arjuna is not compelled; he is illuminated. The next verse will show that Kṛṣṇa has yet one more word — the most secret of all — before falling truly silent.",
        "yogananda": "The greatest teachers always leave students with their freedom intact. God does not want robots — He wants conscious lovers, souls who choose Him freely from the depths of their own understanding. After this vast outpouring of divine wisdom, Kṛṣṇa says: now be still, reflect, and then decide. This 'reflection' (vimṛśya) is itself a form of meditation — turning the teaching inward, letting it become not mere information but inner transformation. 'Aśeṣeṇa' — without leaving any part of yourself untouched by the teaching. When understanding is complete, action follows naturally and rightly, without further struggle.",
        "goyandka": "This verse marks a formal pause in the teaching — a moment of closure before the Lord offers one final, most precious word. The phrase 'yathecchasi tathā kuru' must not be misread as indifference; Kṛṣṇa is not abandoning Arjuna to confusion. Rather, having given the complete teaching, He trusts that Arjuna's reflection (vimṛśya) will lead him to right action. Interestingly, the Lord cannot quite stop here — the very next verse begins 'bhūyaḥ śṛṇu' (hear again), revealing that divine love always has one more word of care to speak. The teaching declared complete in v63 is then surpassed in v64-66."

'Iṣṭo'si me dṛḍham' — you are FIRMLY dear to Me. Not casually, not temporarily, but with the certainty of the Eternal. This is the Lord of the universe confessing His love. He does not speak the next teaching (v65-66) as a philosophical proposition but as the intimate counsel of One who loves Arjuna unconditionally. Every reader of the Gita receives this same declaration: you are dear to the Lord — firmly, eternally — and it is out of that love that He speaks.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The word 'dṛḍham' — firmly — is extraordinary. Divine love is not wavering or conditional; it is firm as the Absolute itself. In Vedāntic terms, this love is not an emotion that comes and goes but the very nature of Brahman, which is Sat-Cit-Ānanda. The Lord's anurāga (deep affection) for the devotee is not dependent on the devotee's worthiness — it precedes all merit. This is what makes it grace. 'Sarva-guhyatamam' — more secret than the secret of Chapter 9, more secret even than what was called 'guhyataram' in v63. The escalation signals that what follows (v65-66) is the Gita's absolute summit.",
        "yogananda": "God loves each soul with a personal, infinite, unwavering love — and the soul's journey is ultimately the journey of awakening to that love which was always there. 'Bhūyaḥ śṛṇu' — hear once more. Like a mother who repeats her most important words to be sure they land, the Lord speaks again from pure love. 'Te hitam' — for your good. Not for the Lord's benefit, not as a transaction, but purely for Arjuna's liberation and joy. When we know we are loved by the Infinite, the fear that drives so much of our religious life dissolves, and we can approach the Lord simply, openly, as the beloved approaches the Beloved.",
        "goyandka": "The word 'bhūyaḥ' (again) reveals the Lord's divine compassion (karuṇā). He had already summarized at v63 but the boundless love in His heart moves Him to offer one final, most precious teaching. This is the nature of the sat-guru: the teaching given from mere duty ends with the lesson; the teaching given from love always finds one more word of grace to offer. 'Iṣṭo'si me dṛḍham' establishes the ground of v65-66: the Lord speaks the carama-śloka not as a divine command but as the advice of One who loves. Surrender to such a Lord is not submission — it is the highest joy."

Man-manā: let the mind dwell in Me; mad-bhakta: let the heart love Me; mad-yājī: let all action be offered as worship; māṃ namaskuru: let the ego bow before Me. These four cover the complete human being: mind, heart, will, and self-sense. When all four are aligned toward the Lord, liberation is not a future possibility but a present trajectory. 'Satyaṃ te pratijāne' — I TRULY PROMISE. This is Bhagavān staking His word. And then again the echo of the previous verse: 'priyo'si me' — you are My beloved. The promise is grounded in love, not merely in cosmic law.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse parallels Chapter 9 verse 34 almost exactly, but here the promise is accompanied by 'satyaṃ te pratijāne' — I truly promise you — which does not appear in Chapter 9. The Gita has been building to this personal, sworn guarantee. The four practices are the complete architecture of bhakti yoga: manana (mind), bhakti (devotion), arcana/yajña (worship), praṇāma (surrender of ego). None requires special qualification. No one is excluded. A human being, whatever their station, can fix their mind on the Lord. 'Mām evaiṣyasi' — only to Me; not to a state of dissolution but to the personal Lord, to Kṛṣṇa Himself.",
        "yogananda": "Kṛṣṇa speaks here as the Divine Friend, the Beloved of the soul, the Guru of gurus. His promise is absolute: practice these four things and you WILL come to Me. Not 'might,' not 'perhaps' — 'you will come.' This is the assurance that no qualified spiritual teacher can give, because it transcends human capacity. Only God can promise God-realization. 'Priyo'si me' — said again, insistently, like a beloved whispering: you matter to Me, your liberation matters to Me, I am personally involved in your journey home. The devotee who truly hears these words can never again feel spiritually abandoned.",
        "goyandka": "The verse forms a complete sādhana-sūtra (summary of practice): four inner movements — mind, devotion, worship, surrender — that together constitute the full turning of the being toward the Lord. Each can be practiced at any moment, in any circumstance. The warrior on the battlefield, the householder at work, the renunciant in the forest — all can practice man-manā bhava. And the result is guaranteed by the Lord Himself: 'satyaṃ te pratijāne.' The word 'satya' (truth) here carries the weight of the Absolute — for the Lord's nature IS truth (Sat). His promise, therefore, cannot fail."

        "dadaji": "This is the carama-śloka — the final, supreme verse of teaching in the entire Bhagavad Gita. Every word carries the weight of the whole scripture. 'Sarva-dharmān parityajya' does not mean abandon righteousness or become immoral. It means: release your grip on every path as your personal project of self-liberation. Release karma-yoga as 'my method.' Release jñāna-yoga as 'my path.' Release even bhakti-yoga as 'my technique.' All these dharmas, precious as they are, become subtle bondage when the ego clings to them as its own spiritual property. True surrender is the abandonment of the very sense that 'I am a spiritual practitioner walking a path to God.' Instead: fall into God directly, completely, right now. 'Mām ekam' — Me ALONE. Not Me plus your efforts, not Me plus your merit, not Me plus your spiritual achievements — Me alone. The greatest obstacle to experiencing the Lord's grace is the spiritual ego that says, 'I am making progress.' That must also be surrendered. When even that last refuge — the refuge of being a 'good devotee' — is released, what remains is pure grace, and pure grace IS liberation. 'Ahaṃ tvā... mokṣayiṣyāmi' — four words that shatter the entire burden of religious effort: I — the Supreme Lord — will liberate — YOU — personally, directly, certainly. Not 'liberation will come to you through your efforts.' Not 'you will attain mokṣa if you qualify.' But: I will liberate you. The agent of liberation is the Lord Himself. The receiver is you — tvā, direct and personal. The action is mokṣayiṣyāmi — a word of absolute certainty, a divine covenant that the Lord seals with His own Being. And then: 'mā śucaḥ' — do not grieve. These are the Gita's opening and closing words of comfort. At the very beginning (Chapter 2, verse 11), when Arjuna collapsed in grief, Kṛṣṇa began His teaching with the rebuke of grief: 'You grieve for those who should not be grieved for.' Now, at the end of everything — after all the philosophy, all the yoga, all the metaphysics — the Lord returns to the same simple human wound: grief. And He addresses it not with more teaching but with a personal promise: I will liberate you. Therefore: do not grieve. The circularity is perfect. The Gita is one enormous arc from grief to liberation, from Arjuna's 'I will not fight' to his declaration after hearing all this: 'My delusion is destroyed; I will do Your word.' And at the center of that arc is this single verse — the Lord's absolute pledge of liberation to every surrendered heart.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Vivekananda called this verse the essence of the entire Gita. Rāmānuja interprets 'sarva-dharmān parityajya' as the abandonment of all means (upāya) other than the Lord Himself — the final step beyond karma, jñāna, and even bhakti as independent paths, into prapatti (absolute surrender) where the Lord alone is both the means and the end. Śaṅkara understands it differently: 'sarva-dharmān' refers to all dharma rooted in the distinction between knower and known — once the non-dual knowledge dawns, the multiplicity of dharmas falls away naturally in the recognition of the One. Madhvācārya sees here the ultimate expression of Bhakti as total dependence (paratantrya) on the Lord. That three of the greatest commentators — Advaita, Viśiṣṭādvaita, Dvaita — each find their tradition's supreme teaching in this single verse is itself testimony to its inexhaustible depth. 'Mā śucaḥ' — do not grieve — is the Lord's gift to every human being who has ever felt the weight of sin, failure, inadequacy, and spiritual unworthiness. The Lord does not say 'when you are worthy I will free you.' He says: surrender now, as you are, and I will free you from ALL pāpa — every sin, every karmic debt, every trace of guilt. This is not cheap grace — it requires the totality of surrender. But it is free grace — unconditional, unearned, motivated entirely by divine love.",
        "yogananda": "In this supreme verse, Kṛṣṇa reveals the final secret that transcends all yoga, all philosophy, all spiritual method: it is not what you DO for God, but what God DOES for you when you completely let go. All the paths — karma, jñāna, bhakti, rāja — are boats that carry you across the river of ignorance. But at the far shore, even the boat must be left behind. 'Sarva-dharmān parityajya' means: even the boat of dharma, at the final moment, must be surrendered. What remains when every support is released? The Lord — who was the ground beneath you all along. This is not despair but the greatest trust. It is the trust of a child in arms, who does not worry because the parent holds. The mystics call this the 'dark night of the soul' — the moment when every spiritual comfort is stripped away — but the Gita calls it the dawn of grace. When Arjuna has nothing left to cling to, not even his spiritual dignity, the Lord says: 'That is when I will carry you. I will liberate you. And you will never grieve again.' Every soul that has read this verse and felt its truth in the marrow of its bones has touched liberation. This is the Gita's final gift: not a method, not a practice, but a direct transmission of the Lord's grace through the medium of sacred words.",
        "goyandka": "The carama-śloka (final supreme teaching-verse) of the Gita is the meeting point of all schools of Vedāntic thought. The word 'parityajya' (having abandoned) uses the absolutive, indicating that the abandonment must be complete before taking refuge — not partial, not tentative. What is to be abandoned? All dharmas — not their outer practice necessarily, but their claim to be the ultimate means of liberation. When one surrenders to the Lord with 'mām ekam' — to Me ALONE — the dharmas continue as natural expressions of love, no longer as the engine of self-liberation. 'Ahaṃ' — the Lord speaking in the first person is the cosmic guarantee. Brahman, the Lord of all existence, pledges His own Being as the agent of liberation. 'Mokṣayiṣyāmi' — the future tense signifies certainty, not merely possibility. The liberation is as certain as the Lord's own existence. 'Mā śucaḥ' — these final two words are the Gita's ultimate benediction: a world without grief is not a fantasy but the natural condition of a soul that rests in the Lord's liberating embrace. Meditate on this verse daily. Let it enter your being word by word. It is the Lord speaking directly to you."

        "dadaji": "After the supreme gift of the carama-śloka, the Lord guards it with four qualifications. The four disqualifications — absence of tapas, bhakti, śuśrūṣā, and presence of abhyasūyā — are not arbitrary gatekeeping but practical wisdom. A teaching of this depth, given to an unprepared heart, is not merely wasted — it can be actively harmful, producing spiritual pride, intellectual cynicism, or misuse of sacred concepts to justify selfish action. The Lord gave this teaching to Arjuna because Arjuna possessed all the positive qualities: he had tapas (the warrior's discipline), bhakti (evident in his love for Kṛṣṇa), śuśrūṣā (his eager listening), and genuine reverence (never abhyasūyā). The teacher of the Gita must similarly discern.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "These four disqualifications together form a portrait of the unprepared seeker. Tapas indicates capacity for the inner discipline that makes philosophy livable. Bhakti ensures the heart is open to receive truth not as mere information but as love. Śuśrūṣā — the desire to serve and listen — is the attitude of receptivity; without it, teaching flows over the surface without penetrating. Abhyasūyā (fault-finding) toward the Lord is the deepest disqualification — for one who approaches scripture with a critical, contemptuous mind cannot receive its grace. This verse protects the transmission of sacred knowledge across generations.",
        "yogananda": "This teaching is not secret because God is exclusive — it is secret because it requires a prepared vessel. Water poured into a cracked pot is lost; the pot must first be made whole. Tapas (discipline) creates the vessel; bhakti purifies it; śuśrūṣā opens it; and freedom from abhyasūyā allows the divine wine to be received without contamination. The Gita's wisdom, like the grace of v66, operates through the laws of spiritual readiness. A guru shares the deepest teachings only when the student's inner readiness matches the teaching's depth. This is not elitism — it is love, for premature teaching harms as surely as premature fruit.",
        "goyandka": "The verse also implicitly defines the qualified student by negative example: the worthy recipient of this teaching is one who HAS tapas, HAS bhakti, HAS śuśrūṣā, and does NOT find fault with the Lord. Such a person is the adhikārī (qualified recipient). The Lord has just given the most liberating teaching in all of creation (v66) and immediately protects its integrity by defining who may receive it. This protects both the teaching and the teacher: the spreader of the Gita must use discernment, not out of hoarding but out of sacred responsibility for the preciousness of what has been entrusted to them."

The giver of this sacred teaching is as blessed as the receiver, and their liberation is equally guaranteed: 'asaṃśayaḥ' — without doubt. Teaching the Gita to sincere devotees is not a scholarly exercise but an act of supreme bhakti. Every word explained, every verse illuminated, every confused heart clarified — these are flowers offered at the Lord's feet. 'Mad-bhakteṣu' specifies the context: teaching among devotees, where the teaching will be received with the reverence it deserves and the sincerity it requires to bear fruit.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse establishes the highest spiritual function of the teacher of Vedānta: not philosophy professor, not intellectual guide, but a bhakta performing pūjā. 'Bhaktiṃ mayi parāṃ kṛtvā' — by teaching, the teacher performs the parā-bhakti (supreme devotion) that the entire Gita has been building toward. The teacher's liberation is not a separate achievement from their teaching — the teaching IS the liberation, for in the act of channeling the Lord's words, the teacher's ego is dissolved in service. 'Asaṃśayaḥ' — the same certainty as the Lord's promise in v65 is now extended to every generation of sincere Gita teachers across time.",
        "yogananda": "What greater privilege can there be than to be the instrument through which God speaks to seeking souls? The teacher of the Gita does not merely transmit information — they transmit the living presence that vibrates within these sacred words. When a sincere teacher explains the Gita to sincere devotees, the Lord Himself is present in the transmission, both in the speaker and in the listener. 'Bhaktiṃ mayi parāṃ kṛtvā' — the teaching itself constitutes the highest devotion. This is why the great commentators — Śaṅkara, Rāmānuja, Madhva, Jñānadeva — attained the highest states: their commentaries were acts of supreme bhakti.",
        "goyandka": "The two-verse sequence of v67-68 forms a complete teaching on the transmission of sacred knowledge: first the disqualified recipients (v67), then the supreme reward of the qualified teacher (v68). The Lord ensures that this transmission chain — from Him through the teacher to devoted students — will continue across all ages. Every sincere teacher of the Gita participates in this divine commission. 'Mad-bhakteṣu' is key: the teaching must flow within the community of devotees, where it will be received, honored, practiced, and passed forward. The Gita is a living teaching, kept alive by this chain of love."

        "dadaji": "The Lord now bestows the ultimate honor upon the teacher of the Gita: not merely liberation, but the superlative of divine love. Among all human beings — past, present, and future — no one does what pleases the Lord more than one who shares this teaching with devoted hearts. This is extraordinary: not the greatest yogi, not the greatest ascetic, not the greatest philosopher, but the sincere teacher of the Gita. Why? Because in teaching the Gita, one does what the Lord most desires: the liberation and illumination of souls. 'Priya-kṛttamaḥ' — the doer of what is MOST dear to the Lord. The highest service IS the service of souls through truth.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The superlative forms here — 'priya-kṛttamaḥ' (most pleasing-doing) and 'priyataraḥ' (more dear) — together affirm both a present reality and a future guarantee. In the present: no one IS more pleasing to the Lord. In the future: no one WILL BE more dear. The teacher of the Gita thus stands in a unique, unsurpassed position of divine love across all of time. This is not merely praise — it is a cosmic declaration about what the Lord values most in human activity. Of all the ways a human being can spend a lifetime, none is more beloved by the Lord than the transmission of this liberating wisdom.",
        "yogananda": "To be God's most beloved — what more could any soul desire? And the Lord declares this not for great world-conquerors or magnificent temple-builders, but for the humble teacher who, in love, shares these sacred words with devoted seekers. The divine economy is entirely different from the human: the greatest in God's sight is the servant of souls, the transmitter of light. 'Bhaviṣyati... priyataraḥ' — shall be more dear — the future tense here encompasses eternity. The teacher of the Gita is eternally, timelessly, the Lord's most beloved among humans.",
        "goyandka": "This verse, combined with v68, makes a definitive statement about the divine status of Gita-teaching as spiritual practice. It supersedes even great individual attainments in terms of what pleases the Lord. The explanation is clear: the Lord's deepest desire is the liberation of all beings. The teacher of the Gita directly serves that cosmic purpose. Every class taught, every commentary written, every conversation that brings this teaching to a sincere seeker — each is an act that places the teacher in the Lord's most-beloved category. This is the Lord's enticement to every able devotee: teach this; share this; nothing will bring you closer to My heart."

Merely studying this dialogue — this dharmyaṃ saṃvāda, this sacred conversation between the Lord and His devotee — constitutes jñāna-yajña, the sacrifice of knowledge. Yajña is the highest religious act in Vedic tradition, the offering that sustains the cosmic order. To study the Gita with sincere attention is to offer the most precious thing one has — one's own awareness — into the sacred fire of wisdom. 'Iti me matiḥ' — this is My considered view. The Lord speaks with humility: not a divine commandment but a considered opinion offered from love.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The escalation across v68-70 is beautiful: v68 honors the teacher, v69 declares them the Lord's most beloved, and v70 extends grace even to the student. No sincere engagement with the Gita goes unrewarded. 'Dharmyam saṃvādam' — the dharmic dialogue. The conversation between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna is not merely a historical event on a battlefield; it is an eternal, living dialogue in which every sincere student participates. When you read the Gita, you are in some mysterious way Arjuna — and the Lord is speaking to you. 'Jñāna-yajñena' — knowledge-sacrifice. The offering of one's ignorance into the fire of understanding is the purest form of yajña.",
        "yogananda": "Every sincere reading of the Gita is an act of communion with God. This is not a metaphor — the Gita itself is a form of the Lord (it is said to be the essence of all the Upaniṣads), and to enter into its words with a seeking heart is to enter the Lord's presence. 'Iṣṭaḥ syām' — I shall be worshipped. The Lord considers Himself honored by your study. Think of that: the Infinite Lord of creation considers Himself gratified when a human being sits quietly and reads His words with sincerity. There is no distance between the devotee's genuine study and the Lord's recognition of it — it is immediate, direct, and certain, as certain as 'iti me matiḥ,' the Lord's own considered view.",
        "goyandka": "The phrase 'iti me matiḥ' is uniquely humble — the Lord uses the word 'matiḥ' (opinion, considered view) rather than an absolute decree. This reflects the Gita's consistent respect for the seeker's intelligence and freedom. The Lord shares His view; the seeker is free to test it through practice. 'Dharmyam saṃvādam āvayoḥ' — of us two: this dialogue belongs equally to Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna, teacher and student together. It is not a monologue but a relationship. Every reader enters that relationship anew. And in that entering — that adhyayana (deep, devoted study) — the Lord counts Himself as having been offered the highest sacrifice. Study the Gita daily; you perform pūjā with every verse."
