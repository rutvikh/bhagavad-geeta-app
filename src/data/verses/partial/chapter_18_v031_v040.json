        "dadaji": "The rajasic buddhi is not wholly blind — it knows the words 'dharma' and 'adharma,' 'kārya' and 'akārya' — but it perceives them ayathāvat, not as they truly are. It confuses, conflates, inverts, and rationalises. The passionate person knows right from wrong in principle but, under the sway of desire, conveniently reinterprets situations to justify what they already wish to do. This is moral self-deception: the intelligence is present but distorted, like a mirror coated with dust. The rajasic person is not evil in the way the tamasic person is; rather, they are inconsistent — sometimes noble, sometimes entirely self-serving — because their discrimination wobbles under the pressure of craving and ambition.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Śaṅkarācārya notes that 'ayathāvat prajānāti' is the key phrase here — the rajasic buddhi perceives, but it perceives wrongly. It is not the utter darkness of tamas; it is more like a flickering lamp in a windy room — sometimes illumining, sometimes misleading. In Vedāntic terms, rajas produces vikṣepa-śakti, the projecting power that overlays reality with fantasy, desire, and self-interest. Such a person may have knowledge of ethical categories but applies them inconsistently: they preach dharma publicly and practice adharma privately, or they convince themselves that a self-serving act is actually their duty. Purification of this buddhi through sattva is the prescription.",
        "yogananda": "The rajasic intellect is restless and therefore unreliable as a moral compass. It sees dharma and adharma — right and wrong — but because it is agitated by desires, fears, and ambitions, it cannot hold to a steady discrimination. Paramahansa Yogananda explained that the rajasic person often justifies every action by saying 'circumstances demanded it' or 'I had no choice' — but these are rationalizations of a mind driven by ego-passions rather than calm reason. The remedy is meditation, which stills the rajasic turbulence and allows the sattvic clarity of the soul to shine through the intellect, giving unconfused, consistent moral perception.",
        "goyandka": "Śrī Jayadayāl Goyandka explains that the rajasic buddhi does not entirely lack discrimination — it has some knowledge of right and wrong — but that knowledge is clouded by self-interest and passion. The word 'ayathāvat' (not as they truly are) is crucial: the rajasic person sees dharma and adharma, but interchanges them according to convenience. They might perform a prohibited act convinced it is their duty, or neglect a genuine duty convinced it is optional. Such confusion arises because rajas turns the intelligence inward toward ego-gratification rather than outward toward truth. Purification through scriptural study, satsaṅga, and the company of the sattvic is the means of correcting this distorted buddhi."

      "commentary": {
        "dadaji": "The tamasic buddhi is not merely confused — it is utterly inverted. Where the rajasic buddhi wobbles between right and wrong, the tamasic buddhi has firmly settled on the wrong side and calls it right. 'Adharmam dharmam iti manyate' — it considers unrighteousness to be righteousness. This is the most dangerous condition of human intelligence: not ignorance of the distinction between good and evil, but the active conviction that evil is good. 'Tamasāvṛtā' — shrouded in tamas — suggests the intellect is not merely dusty but fully covered, like the sun behind a storm-cloud. 'Sarvārthān viparītān' — all meanings, all values, all perceptions are reversed. This is the state of deep spiritual delusion (moha), which only grace and sincere sādhanā can penetrate.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Ādi Śaṅkarācārya observes that while rajasic buddhi errs in application, tamasic buddhi errs in principle — it calls adharma 'dharma' not out of confusion but out of settled conviction enveloped in tamas. The word 'tamasāvṛtā' — enveloped in darkness — indicates āvaraṇa-śakti, the concealing power of māyā that hides reality entirely. 'Viparītān' means inverted: real for unreal, permanent for impermanent, pure for impure, joyful for sorrowful — all the classic inversions that Vedānta attributes to avidyā at its deepest level. The tamasic person cannot easily be reasoned with, because their very instrument of reason — the buddhi — has been captured by darkness. Only exceptional grace can break this tamas.",
        "yogananda": "Paramahansa Yogananda taught that the tamasic mind is the most deeply entrapped in ego-illusion. It does not seek pleasure like the rajasic mind — it is simply mired in inertia and ignorance so complete that it has lost the capacity to distinguish light from darkness. When one calls adharma 'dharma,' one is no longer capable of ordinary moral correction — one needs a radical inner awakening. Yogananda pointed out that this condition is the inner meaning of 'spiritual blindness': not merely not-seeing the truth, but actively perceiving the opposite of truth with full conviction. The sattvic influence of a true guru is the primary remedy, breaking open the shell of tamas with the light of wisdom.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka explains that the tamasic buddhi represents the complete triumph of ignorance over discernment. The verb 'manyate' — believes, considers — is significant: the tamasic person does not merely act wrongly out of temptation (as the rajasic person might) but genuinely believes that adharma is dharma. Every value is inverted: cruelty is called strength, cowardice is called peace, deception is called cleverness. 'Sarvārthān viparītān' — literally, all meanings reversed — points to a total epistemological and moral collapse. Such a person cannot be corrected by scripture alone, since their intellect will misread even scripture to confirm their inversion. Sustained association with saints and the grace of God are the only means of dispelling such entrenched darkness."

        "dadaji": "Dhṛti — steadfastness or fortitude — is now analysed across the three guṇas. Sattvic dhṛti is the inner resolve that holds the entire psycho-physical instrument in alignment with yoga. 'Manaḥ-prāṇa-indriya-kriyāḥ' — the activities of mind, vital force, and senses — these three constitute the complete field of inner life, and sattvic dhṛti integrates all three into a coherent, spiritually directed whole. The key qualifier is 'avyabhicāriṇyā' — non-deviating. The sattvic person's steadfastness does not depend on mood, circumstance, or reward; it holds steady in pleasure and pain alike. This is the dhṛti that sustains jñāna, bhakti, and karma yoga through their full journey to liberation.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The word 'avyabhicāriṇyā' — literally 'that which does not go elsewhere,' non-straying — is the defining characteristic of sattvic dhṛti. In Vedāntic sādhanā, consistency is everything: the mind that meditates today and wanders tomorrow, the will that holds dharma in good times but abandons it under pressure — these are not sattvic dhṛti. Sattvic steadfastness integrates manas, prāṇa, and indriya into a single unified direction toward Brahman. Śaṅkara notes that 'yogenā' here refers to the practice of yoga in its comprehensive sense — the entire discipline of spiritual life — and that dhṛti is the inner backbone that makes such practice possible and consistent.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda explained that sattvic dhṛti is the spiritual will — the deep, soul-rooted determination that does not break under temptation, disappointment, or apparent failure. The spiritual practitioner who perseveres in meditation when it is dry, who maintains ethical discipline when it is inconvenient, who holds to devotion when the heart feels cold — such a person embodies 'avyabhicāriṇyā dhṛti.' The integration of manas (mind), prāṇa (life-force, the subtle energies managed through prāṇāyāma and yoga), and indriya (senses, controlled through pratyāhāra) into a single, unwavering spiritual direction is the hallmark of the sattvic aspirant and the foundation of all genuine spiritual progress.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka emphasises that the word 'dhārayate' — holds together, sustains — implies an active, ongoing effort. Sattvic dhṛti is not passive endurance but the positive, energetic holding of the entire inner life — mind, prāṇa, and senses — in the orbit of spiritual discipline. This dhṛti does not relent when yoga becomes difficult; it does not make exceptions for special circumstances; it does not bargain with the mind. 'Avyabhicāriṇyā' — unwavering — means it never deviates. Such steadfastness is the fruit of deep conviction in the reality of the Ātman and the ultimate goal of liberation, and it is what enables a sādhaka to traverse the entire spiritual path without abandoning it midway."

        "dadaji": "The rajasic dhṛti is disciplined but ego-driven. Such a person pursues dharma, kāma, and artha — the three of the four puruṣārthas (human aims), conspicuously missing mokṣa — with genuine tenacity. They are not lazy; they work hard and hold to their goals. But 'prasaṅgena phalākāṅkṣī' reveals the flaw: they are attached (prasaṅga) and desire the fruit (phala) of every action. Their steadfastness is in service of the ego's agenda. When the results they desire arrive, the dhṛti is rewarded and reinforced; when results fail, the rajasic person is shaken, frustrated, or redirects effort toward a new object. It is the discipline of a highly motivated worldly person — admirable in its energy, but ultimately binding rather than liberating.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The omission of mokṣa from 'dharma-kāma-artha' is deliberate and instructive. Rajasic steadfastness operates within the realm of the three worldly puruṣārthas — even including dharma! — but has no orientation toward liberation. One can be extremely disciplined in pursuing ethical, pleasurable, and material goals and still be entirely rajasic if that discipline is fuelled by attachment and fruit-desire. 'Prasaṅgena' — the word means deep clinging, involvement, entanglement. The rajasic person's will is entangled with their desired outcomes; when outcomes change, the person changes. Sattvic dhṛti, by contrast, holds to the path regardless of outcomes because it is rooted not in desire but in the love of the Highest.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda observed that many sincere and hardworking people exhibit rajasic dhṛti — they are disciplined, determined, and persistent, but everything they do is oriented toward personal gain, family welfare, social standing, or even conventional religious merit. Such steadfastness is not without value; it is far better than tamasic inertia. But it keeps the soul bound to the wheel of karma, because every result desired creates new desires, and every attachment to dharma, wealth, or pleasure reinforces the ego's sense of separate selfhood. The transformation from rajasic to sattvic dhṛti happens when the practitioner begins to offer every action and its fruit to God — when 'phalākāṅkṣā' dissolves into surrender.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka points out that 'prasaṅgena phalākāṅkṣī' is the pair of characteristics that defines rajasic dhṛti: attachment and fruit-desire. A person may hold to all three legitimate goals — dharma (righteousness), kāma (legitimate pleasure), artha (honest wealth) — and their holding may appear noble and commendable. But if there is attachment to these goals and craving for their fruits, the entire edifice of discipline is rajasic. Such a person is firm but fragile: firm in good conditions, but prone to despair, frustration, or compromise when the fruits they seek are withheld. The scriptural prescription for transforming this into sattvic dhṛti is niṣkāma karma — action without attachment to results, as taught at length in Chapter 3."

        "dadaji": "This verse contains a profound and bitter irony: tamasic 'dhṛti' is a kind of steadfastness in darkness. The tamasic person clings — but what they cling to are svapna (sleep, torpor), bhaya (fear), śoka (grief), viṣāda (depression), and mada (arrogance). They are 'firm' in their vices, stubborn in their sloth, tenacious in their negativity. 'Na vimuñcati' — does not let go — is the dark mirror of the sattvic dhṛti that holds to yoga. The tamasic person's 'resolve' is in the service of inertia and delusion. 'Durmedhā' — one of poor or dull intelligence — is the subject: not a person who has chosen evil consciously, but one whose very capacity for discrimination has been extinguished by tamas.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Śaṅkarācārya observes that the list — sleep, fear, grief, depression, arrogance — represents the full spectrum of tamasic dysfunction. Sleep (svapna) here means habitual torpor, the tendency to remain unconscious. Fear and grief are the emotional turbulences that tamas generates and then refuses to release. Viṣāda — depression — is precisely what Arjuna suffered at the opening of the Gītā, and which Kṛṣṇa has spent eighteen chapters addressing. Mada — arrogance — seems out of place in this list until one realises that tamasic pride is the stubbornness that refuses all correction, all teaching, all light. The tamasic person's 'steadfastness' in these states is really the āvaraṇa-śakti of tamas, which conceals all means of escape.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda taught that tamasic 'dhṛti' is the tragedy of wasted human birth. The human will — which has the potential for samādhi, for God-realisation — is spent instead on clinging to sleep, fear, and sorrow. 'Na vimuñcati' — does not release — is the key: the tamasic person could, in principle, let go of these states, but their tamas-driven will actively refuses. Fear reinforces inaction; grief reinforces withdrawal; depression reinforces the conviction that effort is pointless; arrogance reinforces the refusal to seek help or guidance. Breaking tamasic dhṛti requires a sudden and powerful infusion of sattva — ideally through the company of a great saint whose radiant presence can momentarily pierce the tamasic shell.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka explains that 'durmedhā' — translated as dull-witted or of poor intelligence — should not be taken to mean low IQ. Rather, it means one whose discrimination (medhā) has been degraded (dur-) by tamas into a state of functional blindness. Such a person may be clever in worldly matters but utterly without spiritual discernment. They cling to their sleep because effort seems pointless; they cling to fear because they lack faith; they cling to grief because they have not understood the immortal nature of the Ātman (cf. v20 of Ch.2); they cling to depression because their will has been vanquished; they cling to arrogance because ego-pride is the last fortress of the tamasic self. The path out is simple in statement and difficult in practice: begin with satsaṅga, begin with any act of sattva, however small, and tamas will begin to crack."

The opening is significant: 'śṛṇu me' — hear from Me. The Lord is about to reveal something counter-intuitive, something that the ordinary mind would not accept on its own. 'Abhyāsāt ramate' — one rejoices through practice. This points directly to the sattvic happiness described in the next verse: it is not immediate, not accidental, not automatic. It requires practice (abhyāsa). And 'duḥkhāntam nigacchati' — one reaches the end of suffering — points to liberation itself as the ultimate fruit of this happiness. The three kinds of happiness will be shown to have radically different trajectories.",

'Tri-vidham sukham' — threefold happiness — is not about three different emotions but three different qualities of enjoyment, with vastly different consequences. The phrase 'duḥkhāntaṃ ca nigacchati' is the promise: genuine, guṇa-transcending happiness ultimately leads to the end of all suffering. This points the listener toward the sattvic happiness described next, which alone leads beyond the cycle of pleasure and pain.",

'Abhyāsāt ramate' — one rejoices through practice — points to the fundamental law of the spiritual life: joy deepens with sustained practice, whereas sensory pleasure diminishes with repetition. The mention of 'duḥkhāntam' — the end of suffering — is the ultimate promise: that the path of sattvic happiness, faithfully pursued, does not merely give more pleasure but actually dissolves the very root of suffering, which is separation from the Self.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka notes that the word 'abhyāsāt' — through practice — is a crucial qualifier. Kṛṣṇa is not speaking of happiness that happens to the passive recipient, but happiness cultivated through sustained spiritual effort — through meditation, japa, scriptural study, devotion, selfless service. This is why such happiness is sattvic: it requires sattva-dominated effort and in turn deepens the sattva of the practitioner. The promise 'duḥkhāntam nigacchati' — reaches the end of suffering — is nothing less than the promise of mokṣa, because all suffering (duḥkha) ultimately has its root in the identification with the finite ego rather than the infinite Ātman, and sattvic happiness gradually dissolves that false identification."

        "dadaji": "This is one of the most celebrated and psychologically astute verses of the entire Gītā. Sattvic happiness begins as poison — the early stages of sādhanā are marked by discipline, renunciation, facing one's own darkness, sitting in meditation when the mind would rather flee, holding to dharma when the ego rebels. This is the poison. But the end — 'pariṇāme amṛtopamam' — is like nectar, like amṛta, the nectar of immortality itself. The compound 'ātma-buddhi-prasāda-jam' is luminous: this happiness is born of 'prasāda' — grace, serenity, clarity — of the 'buddhi' that has been turned toward the 'Ātman.' It is the happiness of the Self knowing itself, which is not an emotion but the very nature of pure consciousness.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The contrast with verse 38 (rajasic happiness) is perfect and deliberate: rajasic pleasure is amṛta first, viṣa last; sattvic happiness is viṣa first, amṛta last. The two arcs are exactly inverted. 'Ātma-buddhi-prasāda-jam' is a compound worthy of extended reflection: the happiness is born (jam) from the prasāda — the grace, the serenity, the transparency — of the buddhi (intelligence) that has been purified and turned toward the Ātman (Self). This is not intellectual knowledge of the Self but the lived clarity of a mind saturated with sattva, in which the Self's bliss (ānanda) begins to shine through. Every step of sincere sādhanā is a step toward this prasāda.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda loved this verse and often quoted it. He said that the beginner on the spiritual path must understand clearly that the initial discomforts — giving up bad habits, sitting in meditation despite a restless mind, practising non-attachment despite strong desires — are not signs that the path is wrong but signs that it is working. The poison is the ego's resistance to being dissolved. Once that resistance is worn down through sustained practice, the nectar of divine joy begins to flow — and that joy, unlike any sensory pleasure, does not diminish with repetition but deepens without end. 'Amṛtopamam' — like immortal nectar — points to the fact that sattvic happiness participates in the nature of the immortal Self.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka explains 'ātma-buddhi-prasāda-jam' as pointing to a specific causal chain: the buddhi (intellect/inner instrument) is purified until it becomes transparent (prasāda means both grace and clarity, like a still, transparent lake); in that transparency, the Ātman shines through; and from that shining arises a happiness that is not conditioned by any external circumstance. This is why it is called 'born of' — it is not created by the world but revealed by the removal of the veils of rajas and tamas. Goyandka emphasises that 'viṣam iva agre' should not discourage the sādhaka: the initial difficulty is the price of permanent freedom, and every moment of sincere discipline is building toward the ultimate nectar."

        "dadaji": "Rajasic happiness is the happiness the world offers and the world seeks — the pleasure of the senses contacting their objects: beautiful sights, delicious tastes, pleasing sounds, physical touch, gratified desires. At first, it is amṛtopamam — like nectar, genuinely pleasurable, genuinely satisfying. Kṛṣṇa does not deny this. But 'pariṇāme viṣam iva' — at the end, like poison. The end comes in many forms: the pleasure diminishes with repetition and demands more stimulus; the object of pleasure is lost or changes; the craving that remains after pleasure passes is more painful than before; and ultimately, all sensory pleasure reinforces the ego-identification that is the very root of suffering. This is the full arc of worldly happiness: delight, craving, diminishing returns, disappointment, suffering.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The phrase 'viṣayendriya-saṃyogāt' — from the contact of senses and sense-objects — is a precise Sāṃkhya-Yoga technical term. This contact is the very mechanism by which the embodied being experiences the world, and it is inherently unstable: senses change, objects change, the conjunction is always temporary. The pleasure arising from this unstable junction must therefore be unstable. 'Smṛtam' — remembered, held — suggests this is a well-established teaching within the tradition, not a novel claim. The Kaṭha Upaniṣad, the Muṇḍaka, and other texts all confirm that sensory pleasure leads to bondage and ultimately to suffering. Kṛṣṇa is not being ascetic or joyless — He is being precise about the causal structure of pleasure and its inevitable trajectory.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda taught that the rajasic pleasure arc — nectar at first, poison at the end — is the fundamental mechanism by which the soul is kept entangled in saṃsāra across countless lifetimes. Every sensory pleasure promises fulfilment and delivers more craving; every desire satisfied generates two new desires; every worldly joy eventually sours into loss, boredom, or suffering. This is not pessimism but diagnosis. Yogananda emphasised that one should not conclude from this verse that enjoyment of legitimate pleasures is forbidden, but rather that one should begin to recognise the pattern — the 'amṛta first, viṣa last' arc — and use that recognition as motivation to seek the sattvic happiness that reverses the pattern. The spiritual path is not about denial but about the intelligent upgrade of one's source of joy.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka explains that the word 'saṃyogāt' — from the contact/conjunction — points to the essential impermanence of rajasic pleasure. All such pleasure depends on the meeting of two impermanent things: the sense-organ (which changes, ages, and eventually dies) and the sense-object (which is subject to change, loss, and destruction). The pleasure arising from such a conjunction must share the nature of its causes: impermanent, unstable, and ultimately disappointing. 'Pariṇāme viṣam iva' — the Sanskrit 'pariṇāma' means transformation, outcome, digestion — points to what happens when the initial delight is 'digested' by time and reality: it turns to poison. Goyandka urges the reader not to condemn sensory life but to understand it clearly and thereby develop the detachment (vairāgya) that enables the pursuit of sattvic happiness."

Tamasic 'happiness': deluding throughout — 'agre ca anubandhe ca mohanam' — at the beginning and in its continuation, it deludes. This is the most devastating form of false happiness because it never offers even a genuine delight. The pleasures of excessive sleep, sloth, and heedlessness (nidrā, ālasya, pramāda) are not pleasures at all — they are the relief of numbness, the comfort of unconsciousness, the ease of avoiding life. And they delude the self (mohanam ātmanaḥ) throughout: one never sees what one is doing because tamas by definition extinguishes the seeing faculty itself.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The contrast with rajasic happiness is instructive: rajasic pleasure is at least real pleasure at the beginning — there is genuine initial enjoyment, however it may sour. Tamasic 'happiness' is described as 'mohanam ātmanaḥ' — self-delusion — from the very start. It was never pleasure; it is the deception of pleasure, the anaesthesia of consciousness. 'Nidrā-ālasya-pramāda' — sleep, sloth, heedlessness — form a tamasic triad: sleep resists wakefulness, sloth resists effort, and pramāda (heedlessness) resists attention. Together they constitute the complete negation of the alert, discriminating, effortful consciousness that is required for both worldly success and spiritual progress. This is why Kṛṣṇa repeatedly urges Arjuna to 'stand up' — to resist tamas.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda taught that tamasic happiness is the condition of the soul that has forgotten its divine nature so completely that it finds 'comfort' in unconsciousness itself. Excessive sleep, laziness, and heedlessness are not neutral choices — they are the soul's active collaboration in its own bondage. 'Mohanam ātmanaḥ' — self-deluding — means the tamasic person is simultaneously the victim and the perpetrator of their own delusion. The 'pleasure' of sleeping late, of avoiding responsibility, of numbing oneself through distraction — these are not pleasures but the absence of the effort that would reveal the soul's true joy. Yogananda was compassionate but clear: even a small amount of sattva introduced into a tamasic life — through any spiritual practice, however simple — begins the irreversible process of awakening.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka observes that the word 'udāhṛtam' — declared, stated — carries the weight of śāstric authority: this is not merely Kṛṣṇa's opinion but the settled conclusion of the entire Vedic and Vedāntic tradition regarding the nature of tamasic experience. The three causes — nidrā (sleep), ālasya (laziness), pramāda (heedlessness/negligence) — are not random but form an ascending scale of tamasic dysfunction. Nidrā (sleep) refers to physical torpor; ālasya (laziness) refers to the will's refusal to act; and pramāda (heedlessness) refers to the deepest level — the soul's inattention to its own true nature. That this 'happiness' deludes 'both at the beginning and in its continuation' means there is no moment of genuine satisfaction, no honest fruit — only the ongoing fog of self-deception, which only sattva and the grace of the guru can dispel."

The three guṇas — sattva, rajas, and tamas — are the very fabric of Prakṛti (Nature), and there is no entity anywhere within the realm of Prakṛti — neither on earth among humans and animals, nor in heaven among the devas — that is free from their sway. 'Na tad asti' — there is not that — is absolute. This is why guṇa-transcendence (guṇātītatā, described in Ch14) is the very definition of liberation: only by realising the Ātman, which is beyond Prakṛti, does one become truly free. As long as one is identified with any aspect of Prakṛti — including the finest sattva — one remains within the guṇas, however subtly.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "The word 'sattvam' in this verse does not mean the guṇa sattva but means 'being' or 'entity' — any existent creature. The statement is therefore all-inclusive: not one being anywhere in all of creation — from the lowest earthly creature to the highest deva — is exempt from the operation of the three guṇas. Even Brahmā, the creator-god, operates within the guṇas (predominantly sattva, but within Prakṛti nonetheless). This universal scope of the guṇas explains why Kṛṣṇa's teaching of liberation is not about achieving the best guṇa but about transcending all three — guṇātīta. Śaṅkarācārya notes that this verse is the logical culmination of the entire guṇa analysis begun in Ch14 and systematically applied through Ch18.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda taught that this verse should inspire both humility and urgency in the spiritual seeker. Humility: even the most sattvic person — the greatest saint, the most luminous deva — is still within Prakṛti, still subject to the play of the guṇas, and should not rest complacent. Urgency: only complete liberation — realisation of the Ātman beyond all guṇas — is true freedom. Everything short of this remains within the web of Prakṛti, however elevated. This is why Kṛṣṇa did not say 'cultivate sattva and be content' — He said 'go beyond all three guṇas.' Yogananda saw this verse as Kṛṣṇa's loving insistence that the soul not settle for anything less than its full divine nature, which alone is guṇātīta.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka explains that 'prakṛti-jaiḥ' — born of Prakṛti — is the key to understanding the universality of the guṇas. Everything that is born of Prakṛti, everything that has come into manifestation through the creative power of māyā, is necessarily constituted by the three guṇas in some proportion. The only thing that is not born of Prakṛti — that is not a product of manifestation — is the Ātman, the pure witness consciousness, which is therefore by its very nature guṇātīta (beyond the guṇas). This verse thus points directly at the solution it implies: realise the Ātman, and one is automatically beyond all guṇas. This verse concludes the long Sāṃkhya analysis of Ch18 and pivots the chapter toward its discussion of varṇa-dharma and, ultimately, the supreme secret of total surrender to the Lord."
