He does not ask about battles or duties here — he asks about the deepest reality: what is matter, what is Spirit, what is the body, who is the one who knows? This single question unlocks the entire philosophy of Sāṃkhya and Vedānta. Notice how Arjuna addresses Krishna as 'Keśava' — the beautiful one — as if acknowledging that the one who will answer is himself the very consciousness he is asking about. When we sit quietly and ask 'Who am I?' we are repeating Arjuna's question. The seeking itself is the beginning of jñāna.","sarvapriyananda":"Arjuna's six-fold inquiry — Prakṛti, Puruṣa, kṣetra, kṣetrajña, jñāna, jñeya — maps precisely onto the two fundamental categories of Vedāntic analysis: the known and the knower, matter and consciousness. The Sāṃkhya system had already elaborated Prakṛti and Puruṣa as its foundational duality. What the Gītā will do, in verse 3, is transcend even that duality by declaring a non-dual ground. The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad similarly opens with the question 'What, being known, is everything known?' — jñāna and jñeya are not separate; the Knower who truly knows itself knows all. Arjuna's question is philosophically exact and sets the stage for the deepest teaching of the Gītā.","yogananda":"In this blessed chapter, the veil between the outer world and inner Spirit is drawn aside. Arjuna is asking: what is the relation between the body-mind-world complex — Prakṛti, the Field — and the pure Consciousness that witnesses it all — Puruṣa, the Knower? The meditator who has sat long in stillness has already begun to sense this division: on one side is the parade of thoughts, sensations, and phenomena; on the other is the still, luminous Witness that is never disturbed. Arjuna's question is the question that meditation ultimately answers — not through words alone but through direct inner experience of the Self, the Kṣetrajña.","goyandka":"This verse, found in many traditional editions as an interpolation, establishes the subject matter (viṣaya) of the entire thirteenth chapter. The six terms Arjuna uses — Prakṛti, Puruṣa, kṣetra, kṣetrajña, jñāna, jñeya — are not random; they represent the complete structure of Sāṃkhya-Vedānta inquiry. Prakṛti and Puruṣa are the cosmic principles; kṣetra and kṣetrajña are their individual manifestations in each body; jñāna is the means; jñeya is the goal. Śrī Bhagavān will answer each of these in turn. The sincere student of the Gītā should approach this chapter with the same earnest desire as Arjuna — to truly know, not merely to accumulate information."}},{"verse":2,"sanskrit":"श्री भगवान् उवाच —\\nइदं शरीरं कौन्तेय क्षेत्रम् इत्य् अभिधीयते ।\\nएतद् यो वेत्ति तं प्राहुः क्षेत्रज्ञ इति तद्विदः ॥","transliteration":"śrī bhagavān uvāca —\\nidaṃ śarīraṃ kaunteya kṣetram iti abhidhīyate |\\netad yaḥ vetti taṃ prāhuḥ kṣetrajñaḥ iti tadvidaḥ ||","translation":"The Blessed Lord said: This body, O Kaunteya (Arjuna), is called the Field (kṣetra).

Have you noticed that you can observe your hand, your thoughts, your emotions? Whatever you can observe, you are not that. The observer is never the observed. This simple but revolutionary truth — 'I am not the body, I am the one who knows the body' — is the beginning of true self-knowledge. Bhagavān does not say the body is bad or an illusion to be escaped; He calls it a Field — something to be cultivated, worked, understood. But you are the Farmer, not the field.","sarvapriyananda":"This is perhaps the most compressed and most profound verse in the entire Gītā. In the Vedāntic tradition, this teaching is called 'dṛk-dṛśya-viveka' — discrimination between the Seer and the Seen. Whatever is seen, perceived, or experienced is the object — the kṣetra. That which sees, witnesses, or knows is the kṣetrajña — and it is never itself seen or made into an object. The Praśna Upaniṣad and the Kena Upaniṣad elaborate the same paradox: the Self is 'the eye of the eye, the mind of the mind' — It cannot be objectified. The tadvidaḥ — the true knowers — are those who have stabilized in the understanding that 'I am the Witness, not the witnessed.' This is the Ātman teaching in its most essential form.","yogananda":"When you close your eyes and enter deep meditation, a remarkable thing gradually becomes clear: you can watch your thoughts arise and dissolve, you can observe the rhythm of breath, the flow of sensations — and yet 'you,' the watcher, remain untouched and still. That still center of awareness is the kṣetrajña. The body, with its hunger, fatigue, pleasure and pain, is the kṣetra — the field of experience. Yogis who have advanced in their practice report a growing ability to observe even the subtle body — the prāṇa, the mental impressions — as though watching from a great height. This is not imagination; it is the dawning recognition of what you have always been. The meditator's journey is simply to rest ever more firmly in the identity of the Knower rather than being lost in the field.","goyandka":"Śrī Bhagavān begins His answer with a precise philosophical definition: idaṃ śarīram — 'this body' — is the kṣetra. The word kṣetra literally means 'that which is tilled or cultivated,' and it carries the sense of a domain of activity and experience. The body — including the subtle body of mind and ego — is the arena in which karma is enacted and its fruits are reaped. The tadvidaḥ — the scripturally learned and experientially realized knowers — declare that the one who cognizes this field is the kṣetrajña. This kṣetrajña is the immutable, self-luminous Ātman. Śaṃkara's commentary on this verse is definitive: the kṣetrajña is not an agent or enjoyer by nature, but appears so through the superimposition (adhyāsa) of Prakṛti's modifications."}},{"verse":3,"sanskrit":"क्षेत्रज्ञं चापि मां विद्धि सर्वक्षेत्रेषु भारत ।\\nक्षेत्रक्षेत्रज्ञयोर् ज्ञानं यत् तज् ज्ञानं मतं मम ॥","transliteration":"kṣetrajñaṃ ca api māṃ viddhi sarvakṣetreṣu bhārata |\\nkṣetrakṣetrajñayoḥ jñānaṃ yat tat jñānaṃ matam mama ||","translation":"And know Me as the Kṣetrajña (Knower of the Field) in all Fields, O Bhārata.

Not in one special body, not in temples alone, not somewhere far away — in every body, in every creature, the one Knower is present as Me. This is Bhagavān's most intimate revelation: what you call your innermost Self — that awareness behind all your thoughts — is not separate from Me. The individual soul (jīva) and the Supreme Soul (Paramātman) are, in their deepest nature, one. This is the heart of non-dual Vedānta, spoken by Krishna Himself. The practical implication is immense: if the same Consciousness dwells in all kṣetras, then harming another is harming oneself; loving another is loving God. This verse is the philosophical foundation of universal love.","sarvapriyananda":"This is the non-dual climax of the entire chapter's teaching, given before the chapter has barely begun. The individual kṣetrajña in each body — what the Upaniṣads call jīvātman — is not ultimately different from the Paramātman, the universal Consciousness that Krishna here identifies as Himself. The Chāndogya Upaniṣad's 'tat tvam asi' — 'That thou art' — is echoed here: the consciousness you call 'I' and the Consciousness that pervades all kṣetras are one. Śaṃkara reads this verse as the definitive statement of Advaita: there is one kṣetrajña appearing as many through the limitation of individual bodies, just as one sky appears as many skies when reflected in many pots of water. The 'knowledge of both kṣetra and kṣetrajña' is not mere information — it is the liberating recognition of this non-dual truth.","yogananda":"When a master meditator enters the deepest states of samādhi, the boundaries of individual identity dissolve. The awareness that was seemingly confined to 'my' body expands — first to fill the room, then the universe — revealing itself as the one Consciousness that has always been the Witness in all beings. This is not a mystical fantasy; it is what Krishna confirms here as metaphysical fact. 'Know Me as the Kṣetrajña in ALL kṣetras.' In divine vision, the saint sees the same Light of Awareness — the same God — looking out from every pair of eyes. The goal of yoga is precisely this: to experientially realize the oneness of individual and cosmic Consciousness, to know oneself as the one Knower in all Fields.","goyandka":"This verse draws the crucial distinction between the individual and the universal that resolves the apparent paradox of the previous verse. Verse 2 said 'the Knower of the Field' as if each body has its own distinct kṣetrajña. Now Krishna clarifies: in reality, I — the Paramātman — am the one Kṣetrajña in all fields. The apparent multiplicity of individual souls is due to the limiting adjunct (upādhi) of the individual body and mind. True knowledge (jñānam) is declared by Krishna Himself to consist of understanding both kṣetra (what is not-Self) and kṣetrajña (the true Self) — their distinction and their ultimate identity. This comprehensive knowledge liberates the soul from the bondage of identifying with the Field."}},{"verse":4,"sanskrit":"तत् क्षेत्रं यच् च यादृक् च यद्विकारि यतश् च यत् ।\\nस च यो यत्प्रभावश् च तत् समासेन मे शृणु ॥","transliteration":"tat kṣetram yat ca yādṛk ca yadvikāri yataḥ ca yat |\\nsaḥ ca yaḥ yatprabhāvaḥ ca tat samāsena me śṛṇu ||","translation":"What that Field is, of what nature it is, what its modifications are, and from what it arises — and also who the Knower of the Field is and what His powers are — hear that from Me briefly.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_04.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"तत् क्षेत्रम्","meaning":"that Field — what has just been named as the object of inquiry"},{"word":"यत् च","meaning":"what it is — its essential constitution, its components"},{"word":"यादृक् च","meaning":"of what kind it is — its nature and characteristics"},{"word":"यद्विकारि","meaning":"what its modifications/transformations are — the changes it undergoes"},{"word":"यतः च","meaning":"from what it arises — its source or origin"},{"word":"यत्","meaning":"what — what that source itself is"},{"word":"सः च यः","meaning":"and also who that one is — referring to the Kṣetrajña"},{"word":"यत्प्रभावः","meaning":"of what powers/influence — the capabilities and glory of the Knower"},{"word":"तत् समासेन","meaning":"that in brief — a concise summary rather than exhaustive enumeration"},{"word":"मे शृणु","meaning":"hear from Me — listen to Me, receive this teaching directly"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Bhagavān is a perfect teacher — He first states the conclusion (verses 2-3), and then He says, 'Now let Me explain in detail.' This verse is like a table of contents for what follows. He will describe the Field — its composition, its qualities, its changes, its origin — and He will describe the Knower, whose powers include omniscience and omnipresence. The phrase 'samāsena me śṛṇu' — 'hear from Me in brief' — is Bhagavān's gentle invitation. He is not lecturing at a distance; He is speaking intimately, personally. When we read these verses, we should feel that He is speaking to us directly, drawing us into this inquiry about our own innermost nature. The Field is spread out before us every waking moment — our task is to find the Knower.","sarvapriyananda":"This transitional verse announces the structure of the chapter's philosophical teaching. Three questions about the Field: (1) yat — its constitution (answered in vv. 5-6 with the Sāṃkhya enumeration of 24 tattvas); (2) yādṛk — its nature or quality; (3) yadvikāri — its modifications (answered in v. 7 with the list of icchā, dveṣa, etc.). Two questions about the Knower: who He is (the Paramātman, as stated in v. 3), and what His powers are (omniscience and independence from Prakṛti, elaborated later). The dual inquiry mirrors the structure of the Kaṭha Upaniṣad's teaching to Naciketas: both the nature of the self and its ultimate identity with Brahman must be understood for liberation.","yogananda":"This verse reveals that Krishna will give us a complete map of the inner cosmos — the Field with all its territories, and the Knower who transcends the map entirely. For the yogi, this map is invaluable. In deep meditation, one encounters layers of the Field: the physical body, then the energy body (prāṇamaya), then the mental body, then the wisdom sheath. Each layer can be mistaken for the Self. Krishna's detailed description helps the meditator recognize 'this is still the Field — I must go deeper.' The Knower, yatprabhāvaḥ — of immeasurable power — is what the yogi ultimately discovers within: the inexhaustible, self-luminous Ātman that needs nothing from the Field to be fully itself.","goyandka":"This verse serves as an outline (uddēśa) of the remaining teaching of the chapter. Śrī Bhagavān uses five questions about the kṣetra: what (yat), what kind (yādṛk), what modifications (yadvikāri), from what it arises (yataḥ), and what that source is (yat). Then two questions about the kṣetrajña: who He is (saḥ yaḥ) and what His nature and powers are (yatprabhāvaḥ). This methodical approach reflects the Vedic tradition of teaching through adhikāra-krama — proceeding systematically according to the capacity of the student. The word 'samāsena' — in brief — is significant: even what follows is a condensation; the full elaboration exists in the entire Upaniṣadic literature."}},{"verse":5,"sanskrit":"ऋषिभिर् बहुधा गीतं छन्दोभिर् विविधैः पृथक् ।\\nब्रह्मसूत्रपदैश् चैव हेतुमद्भिर् विनिश्चितैः ॥","transliteration":"ṛṣibhiḥ bahudhā gītam chandobhiḥ vividhaiḥ pṛthak |\\nbrahmasūtrapadaiḥ ca eva hetumadbhiḥ viniścitaiḥ ||","translation":"This (knowledge of the Field and the Knower) has been sung by the sages in many ways, distinctly through various Vedic hymns, and also through the reasoned and conclusive aphorisms of the Brahma-sūtras.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_05.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"ऋषिभिः","meaning":"by the sages — the Vedic seers who directly perceived truth in meditation"},{"word":"बहुधा","meaning":"in many ways — in diverse forms, from many angles"},{"word":"गीतम्","meaning":"has been sung, described, elaborated — the root gā means to sing or proclaim"},{"word":"छन्दोभिः","meaning":"through hymns — the chandas (Vedic meters) and the mantras composed in them"},{"word":"विविधैः पृथक्","meaning":"various and distinct — each tradition approaching from a different angle"},{"word":"ब्रह्मसूत्रपदैः","meaning":"through the aphorisms (padāḥ) of the Brahma-sūtras — the Vedānta-sūtras of Bādarāyaṇa"},{"word":"च एव","meaning":"and also — adding this authoritative text"},{"word":"हेतुमद्भिः","meaning":"with reasoning, well-reasoned — the sūtras are noted for their logical rigor"},{"word":"विनिश्चितैः","meaning":"well-determined, conclusive — definitive, not speculative"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Bhagavān is telling Arjuna — and us — that this teaching He is about to give is not new, not invented in the moment of battle. It rests on the deep foundation of the ṛṣis' direct experience and the Brahma-sūtras' rigorous reasoning. There is something deeply reassuring in this. The great seers who composed the Vedic hymns — Vasiṣṭha, Viśvāmitra, Yājñavalkya — all saw the same truth from different angles. 'Bahudhā' — in many ways — means the truth is approached differently by different temperaments, but the truth itself is one. When you feel alone on the spiritual path, remember: you walk a path made wide by countless ṛṣis. Their discoveries are your inheritance.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is remarkable for its explicit acknowledgment of the Brahma-sūtras as an authoritative scriptural source — the only such direct reference in the Gītā. The Prasthānatrayī — the three foundational texts of Vedānta — consists of the Upaniṣads, the Bhagavad Gītā, and the Brahma-sūtras. Here the Gītā itself acknowledges the Brahma-sūtras. The qualifier 'hetumadbhiḥ' is crucial: the sūtras are not mere assertions — they proceed by reason (hetu). Śaṃkara, Rāmānuja, and Madhva all wrote commentaries on the Brahma-sūtras as the definitive philosophical treatise on the nature of Brahman, the kṣetrajña. The Gītā's teaching on the Field and the Knower is thus anchored in the entire Vedic hermeneutical tradition.","yogananda":"Krishna points to the great tradition of wisdom keepers — the ṛṣis who did not merely theorize but who, through deep tapas and meditation, directly experienced the distinction between Field and Knower and encoded that experience in Vedic hymns. The Brahma-sūtras are the analytical crystallization of what the ṛṣis intuitively knew — Reason confirming Revelation. For the sincere seeker today, this tradition remains alive. The scriptures are not historical relics; they are maps drawn by those who actually made the journey. When you meditate and begin to sense the Knower as distinct from the known, you are confirming what the ṛṣis described in the Vedas. You are validating an unbroken lineage of inner discovery.","goyandka":"Śrī Bhagavān here establishes the pramāṇa — the valid means of knowledge — for the teaching that follows. Two sources are cited: śruti (the Vedic hymns, chandobhiḥ) and the Brahma-sūtras (which synthesize śruti through tarka, logical reasoning). This is important because Vedānta accepts three pramāṇas: pratyakṣa (direct perception), anumāna (inference), and śabda (verbal testimony — primarily śruti). The knowledge of the Ātman cannot be derived by sense perception or inference alone; it requires the testimony of the ṛṣis who perceived it directly. The word 'viniścitaiḥ' — conclusive — indicates that the Brahma-sūtras settle all doubts through logical analysis, making this knowledge accessible not just to mystics but to careful reasoners."}},{"verse":6,"sanskrit":"महाभूतान्य् अहंकारो बुद्धिर् अव्यक्तम् एव च ।\\nइन्द्रियाणि दशैकं च पञ्च चेन्द्रियगोचराः ॥","transliteration":"mahābhūtāni ahaṃkāraḥ buddhiḥ avyaktam eva ca |\\nindriyāṇi daśa ekam ca pañca ca indriyagocarāḥ ||","translation":"The five great elements (mahābhūtas), ego (ahaṃkāra), intellect (buddhi), the unmanifest Prakṛti (avyakta), the ten sense organs, and the one (mind), and the five sense objects — (these together constitute the Field).","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_06.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"महाभूतानि","meaning":"the five great elements — earth (pṛthvī), water (ap), fire (tejas), air (vāyu), and ether (ākāśa)"},{"word":"अहंकारः","meaning":"ego — the 'I-making' principle, the sense of individual selfhood in Prakṛti"},{"word":"बुद्धिः","meaning":"intellect — the discriminating, deciding faculty; the finest expression of Prakṛti"},{"word":"अव्यक्तम्","meaning":"the unmanifest — primordial Prakṛti, the undifferentiated matrix before creation"},{"word":"एव च","meaning":"and also, indeed — emphasizing the inclusion of the unmanifest"},{"word":"इन्द्रियाणि दश","meaning":"the ten sense organs — five jñānendriyas (organs of perception: ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose) and five karmendriyas (organs of action: speech, hands, feet, reproductive organ, organs of elimination)"},{"word":"एकम् च","meaning":"and the one — manas, the coordinating mind that receives inputs from all ten sense organs"},{"word":"पञ्च च","meaning":"and the five — the five sense objects"},{"word":"इन्द्रियगोचराः","meaning":"the ranges/objects of the senses — sound, touch, form, taste, smell corresponding to the five sense organs"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse gives us the complete inventory of the Field — everything that is not the Knower. Twenty-four elements in Sāṃkhya philosophy: the unmanifest Prakṛti, then buddhi, then ahaṃkāra, then manas, then the ten sense organs, then the five subtle elements (tanmātras), then the five gross elements — and their corresponding five sense objects. Notice that even ahaṃkāra — the ego, the sense of 'I' — is part of the Field. Even the 'I' you normally identify with is not the Knower. The real Knower is that which observes even the ego arising and subsiding. When you think 'I am tired,' who notices that thought? That noticer is the kṣetrajña. Everything else — body, mind, ego, intellect — belongs to the Field.","sarvapriyananda":"This and the following verse enumerate the twenty-five tattvas of classical Sāṃkhya: the unmanifest Prakṛti (1), buddhi (2), ahaṃkāra (3), manas (4), five jñānendriyas (5-9), five karmendriyas (10-14), five tanmātras as sense-objects (15-19), five mahābhūtas (20-24), and the Puruṣa or kṣetrajña (25). What makes the Gītā's treatment unique is that from the Vedāntic perspective, all twenty-four — including even the finest level of cosmic intelligence (buddhi, avyakta) — are the Field. Only the twenty-fifth, pure Consciousness, is the Knower. The Kaṭha Upaniṣad's chariot analogy maps perfectly: body is chariot, senses are horses, mind is the reins, buddhi is the charioteer — but the self, the owner of the chariot, is other than all of these.","yogananda":"The sages of Sāṃkhya performed a great service by mapping the territory of Prakṛti — the Field — with precision. Every layer of creation is here: from the densest (the five gross elements of earth, water, fire, air, ether) to the subtlest (avyakta — the unmanifest Cosmic Prakṛti). The ahaṃkāra — ego — is particularly significant: it is the subtle mechanism by which the infinite Consciousness becomes seemingly limited to 'this body.' When the yogi, through meditation, begins to see through ahaṃkāra — to observe the ego as an object rather than being identified as the ego — the grip of the Field begins to loosen. Each element listed here corresponds to a stage of inward journey, and each can be recognized and transcended in meditation.","goyandka":"These two verses (6-7) together present the kṣetra in its full Sāṃkhya enumeration. Śrī Bhagavān lists: avyakta (unmanifest Prakṛti), buddhi (mahat-tattva), ahaṃkāra, manas, the ten indriyas, the five sense-objects, and the five mahābhūtas — totaling twenty-four modifications of Prakṛti. The traditional Sāṃkhya counts twenty-four tattvas as prakṛti's domain; with Puruṣa as the twenty-fifth, this is the kṣetra-kṣetrajña classification. The Gīta-Bhāṣya of Śaṃkara notes that 'avyakta' here refers to Mūla-Prakṛti — the primordial causal nature — from which even buddhi and ahaṃkāra evolve. Understanding this enumeration is essential for viveka — discrimination — between what is Self and what is not-Self."}},{"verse":7,"sanskrit":"इच्छा द्वेषः सुखं दुःखं संघातश् चेतना धृतिः ।\\nएतत् क्षेत्रं समासेन सविकारम् उदाहृतम् ॥","transliteration":"icchā dveṣaḥ sukham duḥkham saṃghātaḥ cetanā dhṛtiḥ |\\netat kṣetram samāsena savikāram udāhṛtam ||","translation":"Desire, aversion (hatred), pleasure, pain, the aggregate (the body-mind complex), consciousness (as a modification within the Field), and steadiness (fortitude) — this is the Field described briefly along with its modifications.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_07.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"इच्छा","meaning":"desire — the pull toward what is wanted; the basic movement of Prakṛti toward pleasure"},{"word":"द्वेषः","meaning":"aversion, hatred — the push away from what is unwanted; the root of all conflict"},{"word":"सुखम्","meaning":"pleasure — agreeable sensation arising from contact between sense organs and their objects"},{"word":"दुःखम्","meaning":"pain, sorrow, suffering — the inevitable counterpart of pleasure in the Field"},{"word":"संघातः","meaning":"the aggregate — the composite body-mind-senses as an assembled whole"},{"word":"चेतना","meaning":"consciousness as reflected in the Field — the appearance of awareness in matter, often called 'chidābhāsa'"},{"word":"धृतिः","meaning":"fortitude, steadiness — the capacity of the Field to maintain coherence and resilience"},{"word":"एतत् क्षेत्रम्","meaning":"this is the Field — summarizing all that has been enumerated"},{"word":"समासेन","meaning":"in brief — this is a compressed summary; full elaboration is in the Upaniṣads"},{"word":"सविकारम् उदाहृतम्","meaning":"described along with its modifications — the Field is not static but constantly undergoing change"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Now Bhagavān adds the experiential dimensions of the Field — not just its structure but its dynamic life: desire, hatred, pleasure, pain. These are the winds that blow through the Field every moment of our waking life. Notice that cetanā — consciousness — is listed here as part of the Field. This does not mean your awareness itself is matter. It means the appearance of consciousness within the body — the flickering sense of 'I am aware' that rises and falls — is a reflection of true Consciousness in the mirror of the Field. True Consciousness, the kṣetrajña, never fluctuates. What fluctuates — the moods, the attention, the wakefulness — is cetanā, and it belongs to the Field. Understanding this ends a great confusion: 'I was tired' means the Field was tired; the Knower is never tired.","sarvapriyananda":"The phrase 'cetanā' in this list is philosophically pivotal and has generated extensive commentary. Śaṃkara interprets it as 'chidābhāsa' — the reflection of pure Consciousness in the Field — which creates the appearance of a sentient individual but is itself a modification of Prakṛti. This is the teaching of Vivartavāda: just as a crystal appears red when placed near a red flower without actually becoming red, pure Consciousness appears as a jīva when associated with the Field without actually being modified. The Praśna Upaniṣad describes how consciousness in the waking state, dream state, and deep sleep is all within the Field — the real Consciousness is the Turīya, the fourth, which is the pure kṣetrajña. 'Savikāram' — 'with modifications' — indicates the Field is ever-changing; only the Knower is changeless.","yogananda":"The world of duality — icchā and dveṣa, sukha and duḥkha — is the lived experience of the Field. Every moment of ordinary life is colored by these two pairs: wanting and not wanting, comfort and discomfort. The spiritual path begins when we stop being entirely swept along by these currents and begin to observe them from within. The meditator in stillness watches desire arise in the mind — and does not immediately act on it. Watches aversion arise — and does not flee. In that gap between stimulus and reaction, the kṣetrajña begins to emerge into awareness. Dhṛtiḥ — steadiness — is both a quality of the Field (the body's resilience) and a virtue to be cultivated. The practice of equanimity in meditation trains us to recognize the Knower's inherent steadiness beneath the Field's turbulence.","goyandka":"This verse completes the description of the kṣetra by adding its vikāras — modifications — which are the experiential aspects of the Field: the psychological states (icchā, dveṣa), the experiential qualities (sukha, duḥkha), the composite structure (saṃghāta), the reflected consciousness (cetanā), and the sustaining quality (dhṛti). Together with verse 6, this gives the comprehensive Sāṃkhya-Vedāntic account of the Field. The summary statement 'etat kṣetram samāsena savikāram udāhṛtam' formally closes the kṣetra-prakaraṇa (section on the Field) and prepares the student for the more elevated teaching that follows: the twenty qualities of jñāna (vv. 8-12), through which the kṣetrajña is approached and ultimately known."}},{"verse":8,"sanskrit":"अमानित्वम् अदम्भित्वम् अहिंसा क्षान्तिर् आर्जवम् ।\\nआचार्योपासनं शौचं स्थैर्यम् आत्मविनिग्रहः ॥","transliteration":"amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṃsā kṣāntiḥ ārjavam |\\nācāryopāsanam śaucam sthairyam ātmavinigrahaḥ ||","translation":"Absence of pride (amānitva), absence of hypocrisy (adambhitva), non-violence (ahiṃsā), patience and forbearance (kṣānti), uprightness (ārjava), service to the teacher (ācāryopāsana), purity (śauca), steadiness (sthairya), self-control (ātmavinigraha)...","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_08.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अमानित्वम्","meaning":"absence of pride — not craving respect, honor, or recognition; freedom from the need to be considered important"},{"word":"अदम्भित्वम्","meaning":"absence of hypocrisy/deceit — not performing virtuous actions for show; authenticity without pretense"},{"word":"अहिंसा","meaning":"non-violence — not causing harm in thought, word, or deed; the bedrock of dharmic conduct"},{"word":"क्षान्तिः","meaning":"patience, forbearance — the capacity to bear hardship, insult, and adversity without being disturbed"},{"word":"आर्जवम्","meaning":"uprightness, straightforwardness — the alignment of thought, speech, and action; integrity"},{"word":"आचार्योपासनम्","meaning":"service/devotion to the teacher — attending to the guru with humility, learning through relationship and seva"},{"word":"शौचम्","meaning":"purity — both outer cleanliness and inner purity of motive, thought, and intention"},{"word":"स्थैर्यम्","meaning":"steadiness — the quality of remaining firm and unshaken in one's conviction and practice"},{"word":"आत्मविनिग्रहः","meaning":"self-control — mastery over the mind and senses; the redirection of energy inward toward Self-knowledge"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Now begins the golden section of Chapter 13 — the twenty qualities that Krishna calls 'jñānam,' knowledge itself. This is one of the most practical passages in all the Gītā. Bhagavān does not define jñāna as merely intellectual understanding; He defines it as a way of being. The first quality is amānitvam — the absence of pride. Notice it comes before ahiṃsā, before scholarship, before everything. Why? Because pride is the subtlest and most persistent cover over the kṣetrajña. As long as we crave recognition — 'know me, honor me, see how much I know' — the ego is in charge, and the Knower remains hidden. Adambhitvam — no hypocrisy — is the next step: no performance of virtue for applause. Then the great qualities unfold. Each one of these is not a rule to follow; it is a description of what the soul naturally becomes as it turns toward the kṣetrajña.","sarvapriyananda":"This celebrated passage (vv. 8-12) is sometimes called the 'Jñāna Lakṣaṇa' — the characteristics or marks of wisdom. What is philosophically profound is that Krishna does not enumerate the marks of wisdom as abstract virtues but as the natural qualities that emerge from right understanding of the kṣetra-kṣetrajña relationship. If I truly know that I am the Knower, not the body, I will naturally become humble — who is there for me to be proud before? If I see the same Consciousness in all kṣetras, non-violence becomes effortless. Ācāryopāsana — service to the teacher — is listed here as a mark of wisdom because Self-knowledge in the Vedāntic tradition is not a solo intellectual achievement; it requires transmission from a realized teacher. The Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad is emphatic: 'Let him approach a teacher who is śrotriya and brahmiṣṭha — versed in scripture and established in Brahman.'","yogananda":"These nine qualities in verse 8 are the spiritual qualities that form the foundation of a yogic life. Amānitvam — freedom from pride — is the prerequisite for genuine spiritual development. Pride is the wall between the individual ego and the universal Self. It says 'I am superior, I am special' — and in doing so, it cuts off the experience of unity. Ahiṃsā is the practical expression of the understanding that all beings share one Consciousness; harming another is in some sense harming the universal Self. Ācāryopāsana — devotion to one's teacher — is particularly vital in the yoga tradition: the transmission of wisdom requires a living relationship. The guru does not just give information; the guru's presence itself is transformative for the sincere disciple.","goyandka":"Śrī Bhagavān here begins the enumeration of twenty qualities that He terms 'jñānam' — knowledge. This surprising definition (knowledge as ethical and spiritual qualities rather than mere cognition) reflects the Vedāntic view that true Self-knowledge is inseparable from purity of character. A mirror covered with dust cannot reflect clearly; similarly, a mind clouded by pride, deceit, or restlessness cannot reflect the light of the kṣetrajña. Each quality listed is therefore both a means (sādhana) to jñāna and a result (phala) of advancing jñāna. Amānitvam is mentioned first as it is the foundation: the wise person does not claim the honor that belongs only to the Self. Ācāryopāsana — discipleship to a qualified teacher — is the prescribed means for receiving this knowledge in the sampradāya tradition."}},{"verse":9,"sanskrit":"इन्द्रियार्थेषु वैराग्यम् अनहंकार एव च ।\\nजन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिदुःखदोषानुदर्शनम् ॥","transliteration":"indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam anahaṃkāraḥ eva ca |\\njanma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣa-anudarśanam ||","translation":"...dispassion (vairāgya) toward sense objects; absence of ego (anahaṃkāra); and the clear perception of the evil inherent in birth, death, old age, sickness, and pain...","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_09.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"इन्द्रियार्थेषु","meaning":"toward the objects of the senses — sounds, touches, forms, tastes, smells; the entire domain of sensory experience"},{"word":"वैराग्यम्","meaning":"dispassion, detachment — not suppression of feeling but freedom from compulsive craving; equanimity before sensory stimuli"},{"word":"अनहंकारः","meaning":"absence of ego — not the destruction of functional identity but the dissolution of the false identification with the body-mind as the ultimate Self"},{"word":"एव च","meaning":"and also, indeed — emphasizing the importance of these qualities"},{"word":"जन्म","meaning":"birth — the beginning of embodiment, which carries with it the inevitability of the subsequent sufferings"},{"word":"मृत्यु","meaning":"death — the dissolution of the body, which the ego fears above all things"},{"word":"जरा","meaning":"old age — the gradual decay of the body; the suffering of diminishment"},{"word":"व्याधि","meaning":"disease, sickness — the vulnerability of the physical body to illness and pain"},{"word":"दुःख","meaning":"suffering, pain — the pervasive quality of existence in the Field when mistaken for the whole of reality"},{"word":"दोष","meaning":"the inherent defect, evil — the fundamental inadequacy of sense-bound existence as a source of lasting happiness"},{"word":"अनुदर्शनम्","meaning":"clear and steady perception — not a passing thought but a settled, repeated seeing of this truth"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Vairāgya — dispassion toward sense objects — does not mean becoming cold or indifferent to beauty and life. It means no longer being a slave to the senses. The one who has vairāgya can enjoy a flower without needing to possess it, can appreciate music without being driven by craving for more. And anahaṃkāra — the absence of ego — is the fruit of truly understanding that I am the kṣetrajña, not the body. The ego shrinks when we stop identifying with the Field. Then comes the remarkable phrase: 'anudarśanam' — steady seeing — of the doṣa in birth, death, old age, and disease. This is not pessimism; it is sober clarity. Until we see honestly that the body is subject to inevitable decay, we will keep investing our deepest self in what cannot last. Seeing this clearly is itself a form of freedom.","sarvapriyananda":"Vairāgya — here 'indriyārtheṣu vairāgyam,' dispassion specifically toward sense objects — is listed as the tenth of the twenty marks of wisdom. In the Vivekacūḍāmaṇi, Śaṃkara identifies vairāgya as one of the four prerequisites for Vedāntic inquiry (sādhana-catuṣṭaya), alongside viveka (discrimination), mumukṣutva (desire for liberation), and the six-fold inner discipline. Anahaṃkāra — absence of ego — is philosophically identical to the removal of the false superimposition (adhyāsa) of individuality upon pure Consciousness. 'Janmamṛtyujarāvyādhiduḥkhadoṣānudarśanam' — steady seeing of the defects of birth, death, old age, disease, and suffering — is precisely the 'pratīka' (mark) of the mumukṣu described in the Kaṭha Upaniṣad. Naciketas demonstrates it by refusing all worldly pleasures Yama offers.","yogananda":"The great sages cultivated vairāgya not through harsh suppression but through the growing recognition that what they had always sought — lasting bliss, perfect love, boundless peace — simply could not be found in the realm of the senses. Each sense pleasure has a ceiling; each joy in the Field is followed by its opposite. As meditation deepens, the yogi tastes the inner bliss of the Ātman — the ānanda of the kṣetrajña — and sensory pleasures naturally lose their hypnotic grip, not through effort but through comparison. Anahaṃkāra is the natural result of this inner discovery: when you have found the infinite, the little ego-self becomes transparent. 'Anudarśanam' — steady clear seeing — of the suffering inherent in embodiment (janma, mṛtyu, jarā, vyādhi) is what the Buddha called the First Noble Truth; it is not meant to depress but to motivate the deepest aspiration for liberation.","goyandka":"Vairāgya toward sense objects is the eleventh quality in this list (following the nine of verse 8 and now continuing). The Bhagavān's definition of vairāgya here is precise: it is specifically toward 'indriyārthas' — sense objects — not toward one's duties or relationships per se. Anahaṃkāra — absence of ego — is not the annihilation of individuality for functional purposes but the removal of the fundamental error of identifying the Ātman with the body-mind. The compound 'janmamṛtyujarāvyādhiduḥkhadoṣānudarśanam' is notable for its use of the word 'doṣa' — defect or evil — applied to birth itself. This reflects the Vedāntic view that bondage begins with birth into the cycle of saṃsāra, and liberation means freedom from this cycle. 'Anudarśanam' — repeated, sustained seeing — implies that intellectual understanding alone is insufficient; the seeker must contemplate this truth until it becomes an unshakeable conviction."}},{"verse":10,"sanskrit":"असक्तिर् अनभिष्वङ्गः पुत्रदारगृहादिषु ।\\nनित्यं च समचित्तत्वम् इष्टानिष्टोपपत्तिषु ॥","transliteration":"asaktiḥ anabhiṣvaṅgaḥ putra-dāra-gṛha-ādiṣu |\\nnityam ca samacittatvam iṣṭa-aniṣṭa-upapattiṣu ||","translation":"...non-attachment (asakti) and freedom from excessive clinging (anabhiṣvaṅga) to son, wife, home, and so forth; and constant evenness of mind (samacittatva) in the occurrence of desired and undesired events...","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_10.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"असक्तिः","meaning":"non-attachment — the absence of binding clinging to outcomes, relationships, or possessions; freedom from the compulsion of 'mine'"},{"word":"अनभिष्वङ्गः","meaning":"freedom from excessive clinging — a stronger form of non-attachment; not being engulfed or overwhelmed by love of family and home; the prefix 'ana-abhi-' suggests freedom from obsessive, suffocating attachment"},{"word":"पुत्र","meaning":"son — used representatively for all children; the deepest and most natural object of parental attachment"},{"word":"दार","meaning":"wife — the primary intimate relationship; the domestic bond"},{"word":"गृह","meaning":"home — the house, property, and the entire domestic sphere; everything that constitutes 'mine'"},{"word":"आदिषु","meaning":"and so forth — extending to all personal possessions, relationships, identities, and roles"},{"word":"नित्यम्","meaning":"constantly, always — not occasionally but as a stable disposition; evenness that has become natural"},{"word":"समचित्तत्वम्","meaning":"evenness of mind — equanimity; sama = equal/same, citta = mind; the mind that does not rise or fall with circumstances"},{"word":"इष्ट","meaning":"desired — pleasant, wished-for events and circumstances"},{"word":"अनिष्ट","meaning":"undesired — unpleasant, unwanted events; things that go wrong"},{"word":"उपपत्तिषु","meaning":"in the occurrences, in the happening of — when these events actually arrive"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This verse touches the most difficult territory for most of us: our relationship to the ones we love. Asakti and anabhiṣvaṅga toward son, wife, home — these words do not ask us to love less. They ask us to love without grasping, without the terror of loss coloring every moment of love. When we cling to those we love, that clinging is born of the ego's fear. The kṣetrajña — the true Self — loves without clinging because it knows that at the deepest level, the same Consciousness dwells in us and in our loved ones. Then comes samacittatvam — evenness of mind in all that happens, desired or undesired. Nityam — constantly. Not when things are easy, but as a permanent quality of being. This is the goal of all spiritual practice: not to be indifferent to life, but to be so rooted in the Knower that the Field's storms do not capsize the boat.","sarvapriyananda":"The distinction between 'asakti' and 'anabhiṣvaṅga' is subtle and important. Asakti is non-attachment in principle — not identifying with or possessively grasping at objects and relationships. Anabhiṣvaṅga is the further quality of not being emotionally swamped or engulfed — not clinging with desperate intensity. The Bhāgavata Purāṇa's teaching on the bhakta who loves God more than family is relevant here: it does not destroy natural love but elevates and purifies it. 'Samacittatvam' — evenness of mind in iṣṭa and aniṣṭa — is what the Stoics called apatheia and what Patañjali in the Yoga Sūtras calls 'maitrī, karuṇā, muditā, upekṣā' — the four attitudes that maintain equanimity. The Gītā repeatedly returns to this quality (2.48: yoga is equanimity; 6.8: the yogi who is equal in honor and dishonor). It is the natural expression of the kṣetrajña's unshakeable identity.","yogananda":"Non-attachment to family and home does not mean abandoning them or becoming emotionally disconnected. The great householder-saints of India — Janaka, Yudhiṣṭhira, and countless others — demonstrated that one can fulfill all one's worldly responsibilities while remaining inwardly free. The key is the word 'anabhiṣvaṅga' — no suffocating clinging, no desperate grasping. When we love without grasping, our love actually becomes purer and more expansive. The constant evenness of mind — 'nityaṃ samacittatvam' — in all events, whether things go our way or not, is the deepest fruit of yogic practice. The meditator who has touched the unchanging awareness of the kṣetrajña finds that outer events, however turbulent, cannot truly disturb the inner stillness. This equanimity is not cultivated coldness; it is the natural peace of one established in the Self.","goyandka":"This verse contains two distinct qualities: (1) asakti and anabhiṣvaṅga — the two aspects of non-attachment to domestic relationships; and (2) nityaṃ samacittatvam — constant equanimity. Together with verses 8-9, these five verses (8-12) describe the twenty qualities of jñāna. Commentators note that putra-dāra-gṛha are mentioned not to suggest that family life is an obstacle, but because these are the strongest bonds of saṃsāric attachment. 'Anabhiṣvaṅga' literally means 'no clinging' (svaṅga = cling or embrace) — the quality of caring for one's family without being bound by the ego's need for them to validate or complete oneself. 'Samacittatvam in iṣṭāniṣṭopapattiṣu' — evenness when desired or undesired events occur — is not passivity but the mature response of the jñānī who knows that what happens in the Field does not affect the Knower."}},{"verse":11,"sanskrit":"अध्यात्म-ज्ञान-नित्यत्वं तत्त्व-ज्ञानार्थ-दर्शनम् । एतज् ज्ञानम् इति प्रोक्तम् अज्ञानं यद् अतोऽन्यथा ॥","transliteration":"adhyātma-jñāna-nityatvaṃ tattva-jñāna-artha-darśanam | etat jñānam iti proktam ajñānaṃ yat ataḥ anyathā ||","translation":"Constant absorption in self-knowledge (adhyātma-jñāna), and insight into the purpose and meaning of tattva-jñāna — this is declared to be knowledge (jñānam); whatever is contrary to this is ignorance (ajñānam).","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_11.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अध्यात्म-ज्ञान","meaning":"knowledge of the Self; self-knowledge; spiritual self-inquiry"},{"word":"नित्यत्वम्","meaning":"constancy; permanence; the quality of being ever-abiding"},{"word":"तत्त्व-ज्ञान","meaning":"knowledge of the truth; knowledge of the essential nature of reality"},{"word":"अर्थ","meaning":"purpose; meaning; aim; the goal toward which knowledge is directed"},{"word":"दर्शनम्","meaning":"vision; insight; clear seeing; perception of truth"},{"word":"एतत्","meaning":"this; referring to the twenty qualities listed from verse 8 onward"},{"word":"ज्ञानम्","meaning":"knowledge; wisdom; the state of genuine knowing"},{"word":"इति प्रोक्तम्","meaning":"is thus declared; has been said to be so"},{"word":"अज्ञानम्","meaning":"ignorance; absence of true knowledge; the root of bondage"},{"word":"यत्","meaning":"that which; whatever"},{"word":"अतः अन्यथा","meaning":"contrary to this; otherwise than what has been described"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Beloved, Shri Krishna concludes His luminous list of twenty qualities of wisdom with these two crown jewels: the unwavering abidance in self-knowledge, and the clear vision of what Truth-knowledge truly means. He tenderly tells us that all qualities from humility to devotion are not mere virtues but expressions of jñāna itself. Whatever falls short of this — pride, cruelty, restlessness — is nothing but ajñāna, darkness pretending to be light. Let your life be a constant prayer toward knowing the Self, and all else will fall into its rightful place.","sarvapriyananda":"From the Advaita standpoint, this closing verse of the jñāna-lakṣaṇa section is particularly significant. Krishna defines jñāna not merely as intellectual information but as nityatva — unbroken abidance — in adhyātma-jñāna, the knowledge 'I am the Self.' Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam means the sustained insight into the very purpose of Self-knowledge, which is liberation from the false identification with the kṣetra. The twenty qualities described from verse 8 are thus not prerequisites for jñāna but rather its very characteristics — the flower through which the fragrance of Self-knowledge is known.","yogananda":"Master Patanjali taught that wisdom is a living flame that must burn continuously without interruption. That is precisely what Krishna means by adhyātma-jñāna-nityatva — not occasional meditation but a ceaseless inward attunement to the divine Self within. Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam is the penetrating insight that sees through all appearances to the single Truth underlying creation. When this flame of Self-knowledge burns brightly, ignorance — which is merely the absence of that light — dissolves as naturally as darkness before the dawn.","goyandka":"This verse serves as the conclusive definition-verse (lakṣaṇa-śloka) closing the twenty-quality enumeration that began at verse 8. Śrī Śaṅkarācārya notes that 'adhyātma-jñāna-nityatva' refers to the continuous inclination (nitya-pravṛtti) of the mind toward the knowledge of the Supreme Self, not merely occasional study. 'Tattva-jñānārtha-darśanam' signifies seeing the ultimate purpose (mokṣa) for which tattva-jñāna exists. The verse establishes a clear epistemic standard: any mental orientation contrary to these — identification with body, ego-assertion, sensory craving — belongs to the domain of ajñāna and is the cause of saṃsāra."}},{"verse":12,"sanskrit":"ज्ञेयं यत् तत् प्रवक्ष्यामि यज् ज्ञात्वाऽमृतम् अश्नुते । अनादि मत्-परं ब्रह्म न सत् तन् नासद् उच्यते ॥","transliteration":"jñeyam yat tat pravakṣyāmi yat jñātvā amṛtam aśnute | anādi mat-param brahma na sat tat na asat ucyate ||","translation":"I will declare that which is to be known — knowing which, one attains immortality.

Know this and you shall never die.' That jñeyam, the knowable, is Brahman — beginningless, with Krishna Himself as its highest expression. It is not a 'thing' that exists like a pot or a planet, nor is it a mere nothing. It transcends both existence and non-existence because it is the very ground from which those categories arise. This is the knowledge that breaks the cycle of birth and death and bestows immortality — not a future event but the recognition of what you have always been.","sarvapriyananda":"The phrase 'na sat tan nāsad ucyate' is of profound Vedāntic significance. Brahman cannot be called 'sat' in the way the phenomenal world claims existence, because It has no limiting adjuncts, no specific locus, and is not an object of perception. Yet It cannot be called 'asat' (non-existent) like a sky-flower or a barren woman's son, because It is self-luminously real. The Upaniṣads similarly declare Brahman as 'neti neti' — not this, not this. 'Anādi mat-param brahma' establishes that this Brahman is not a created entity; It is the beginningless substratum, and Krishna, as Paramātman, is its supreme reality.","yogananda":"When the great Sages say God is beyond description, they do not mean He is unknowable in experience — they mean He is beyond the imprisonment of concepts. 'Na sat, na asat' — not the kind of existence that things have, not the kind of absence that vacuums have. He is the Infinite Presence that underlies both. Knowing this Brahman — through deep meditation and the grace of a true Guru — one tastes amṛtam, the nectar of immortality, the direct experience that one's own consciousness is the deathless divine. This is the supreme promise Krishna makes to every sincere seeker.","goyandka":"This verse inaugurates the jñeyam-prakaraṇa (section on the knowable) which extends through verse 18. The term 'anādi mat-param brahma' is analyzed by commentators in two ways: (1) mat-param = having Paramātman as its inner controller and highest expression, or (2) mat-param = known through My grace. The ontological status of Brahman as 'neither sat nor asat' follows the Upaniṣadic method of exclusion (apavāda). Brahman is not sat like the temporary objects of the world, and not asat like an illusion; It is sat-cit-ānanda — pure existence-consciousness-bliss — which the sat/asat dichotomy cannot capture."}},{"verse":13,"sanskrit":"सर्वतः पाणि-पादं तत् सर्वतोऽक्षि-शिरो-मुखम् । सर्वतः श्रुतिमल् लोके सर्वम् आवृत्य तिष्ठति ॥","transliteration":"sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādam tat sarvataḥ akṣi-śiraḥ-mukham | sarvataḥ śrutimat loke sarvam āvṛtya tiṣṭhati ||","translation":"It has hands and feet everywhere; eyes, heads, and mouths everywhere; ears everywhere — it stands pervading everything in the world.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_13.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"सर्वतः","meaning":"everywhere; on all sides; in every direction"},{"word":"पाणि-पादम्","meaning":"hands and feet; the organs of action"},{"word":"तत्","meaning":"that; referring to Brahman, the jñeyam being described"},{"word":"अक्षि","meaning":"eyes; organs of sight"},{"word":"शिरः","meaning":"heads; the seat of intelligence"},{"word":"मुखम्","meaning":"mouths; faces; the organ of speech and intake"},{"word":"श्रुतिमत्","meaning":"possessing ears; having hearing everywhere; the quality of universal perception"},{"word":"लोके","meaning":"in the world; in the universe; among all beings"},{"word":"सर्वम्","meaning":"everything; all; the entire universe without exception"},{"word":"आवृत्य","meaning":"pervading; enveloping; encompassing; having covered"},{"word":"तिष्ठति","meaning":"stands; exists; remains; abides — used for the immanent presence of Brahman"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Shri Krishna paints the most breathtaking portrait of the Beloved — not with a brush but with the language of omnipresence.

Brahman is not distant in some heaven; It pervades every corner of this world, behind every form and every function. When this understanding dawns even partially, one begins to see the sacred in everything and everyone, and love flows naturally toward all of creation.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse follows the classical Vedāntic description of Brahman's immanence through the via positiva — attributing all qualities universally. From the Advaita perspective, Brahman does not literally have limbs, but since all hands, feet, eyes, and ears are expressions of one consciousness, it is not wrong to say Brahman perceives through every eye and acts through every hand. This is not pantheism (the world equals God) but panentheism (the world is in God, and God pervades the world while transcending it). The Puruṣa-sūkta of the Ṛgveda resonates here — the cosmic Person whose feet are the earth, whose eye is the sun.","yogananda":"The cosmic vision described here is what the great masters experience in their highest states of samādhi: the entire universe perceived as one pulsating divine body. Every star is God's eye; every river His voice; every wind His breath. Paramhansa Ramakrishna would enter ecstasy seeing God in every face. This verse is not mythology — it is a precise description of what the awakened consciousness perceives. All of creation is one organism, and Brahman is the single life animating every cell of it. To know this even intellectually begins the journey; to experience it is liberation itself.","goyandka":"The description in this verse echoes the famous Puruṣa-sūkta (Ṛgveda 10.90) and the Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad (3.16): 'sarvataḥ pāṇi-pādas tat sarvato'kṣi-śiro-mukham.' The repetition of 'sarvataḥ' four times emphasizes the total, unrestricted pervasiveness of Brahman. Commentators note that the attribution of sense organs is metaphorical (upacāra), not literal — Brahman being niravayava (without parts). The real meaning: there is no region of the universe, no function of life, no moment of experience where Brahman is absent. It 'stands' (tiṣṭhati) — indicating immovable steadiness even while pervading movement."}},{"verse":14,"sanskrit":"सर्वेन्द्रिय-गुणाभासं सर्वेन्द्रिय-विवर्जितम् । असक्तं सर्व-भृच् चैव निर्गुणं गुण-भोक्तृ च ॥","transliteration":"sarva-indriya-guṇa-ābhāsam sarva-indriya-vivarjitam | asaktam sarva-bhṛt ca eva nirguṇam guṇa-bhoktṛ ca ||","translation":"Appearing as the illumined functions of all senses, yet devoid of all senses; unattached, yet sustaining everything; free from the guṇas, yet experiencing (or appearing as the enjoyer of) the guṇas.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_14.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"सर्व-इन्द्रिय","meaning":"all the senses; every sensory faculty — sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell"},{"word":"गुण-आभासम्","meaning":"appearing as the functions/qualities; reflecting the characteristics; the ābhāsa (reflection/appearance) of sense-functions"},{"word":"सर्व-इन्द्रिय-विवर्जितम्","meaning":"devoid of all senses; without any sense organs; transcending sensory apparatus"},{"word":"असक्तम्","meaning":"unattached; without clinging; free from any dependency or involvement"},{"word":"सर्व-भृत्","meaning":"the sustainer of all; the support of everything; the one who bears and maintains the universe"},{"word":"च एव","meaning":"and also; indeed; emphasizing the conjunction of seemingly opposite qualities"},{"word":"निर्गुणम्","meaning":"without guṇas; beyond the three attributes of Prakṛti; transcending sattva, rajas, and tamas"},{"word":"गुण-भोक्तृ","meaning":"the experiencer/enjoyer of the guṇas; appearing as though experiencing the three qualities"},{"word":"च","meaning":"and; also; indicating the paradoxical conjunction"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Beloved, here Shri Krishna reveals the great mystery of how God can be everything and yet untouched by anything.

The paradoxes in this verse — 'with senses / without senses,' 'unattached / sustains all,' 'nirguṇa / guṇa-bhoktā' — are the language of the Absolute describing Itself through the lens of Māyā. In pure Advaita, Brahman is nirguṇa and asaṅga; the appearance of guṇa-enjoyment belongs only to the upādhi (limiting adjunct), not to Brahman Itself.","yogananda":"The spiritual law revealed here is this: the divine Consciousness that you seek is the very power by which you seek. It illumines your eyes so you can look for it, energizes your mind so you can think about it — and all the while remains perfectly still, unentangled, free. This is why great teachers say 'You cannot attain God; you can only recognize that God is already what you are.' The guṇas play their dance of creation; Brahman is the silent stage. Asaktam — unattached — is the key word. No matter how tumultuous life becomes, the Self within is always asaktam, always free, always at peace.","goyandka":"Śrī Śaṅkarācārya's commentary on this verse emphasizes that 'guṇābhāsam' does not mean Brahman literally possesses the qualities of senses, but that It is the chit-śakti (consciousness-power) that illumines (ābhāsayati) the sense-functions. The four paradoxical pairs in this verse mirror the mahāvākya method: Brahman transcends description yet must be described. Viśiṣṭādvaitins like Rāmānuja interpret 'sarva-bhṛt' as the inner controller (antaryāmin) who sustains all, while 'guṇa-bhoktṛ' refers to the jīvātman within Brahman's body. In either school, Brahman's sovereign independence from Prakṛti remains uncompromised."}},{"verse":15,"sanskrit":"बहिर् अन्तश् च भूतानाम् अचरं चरम् एव च । सूक्ष्मत्वात् तद् अविज्ञेयं दूर-स्थं चान्तिके च तत् ॥","transliteration":"bahiḥ antaḥ ca bhūtānām acaram caram eva ca | sūkṣmatvāt tat avijñeyam dūra-stham ca antike ca tat ||","translation":"It is outside and inside all beings; it is moving and also unmoving; because of Its subtlety It is incomprehensible; It is far away and yet near.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_15.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"बहिः","meaning":"outside; external; beyond the surface of beings"},{"word":"अन्तः","meaning":"inside; within; the interior of all beings"},{"word":"च","meaning":"and; both; indicating simultaneous coexistence of opposites"},{"word":"भूतानाम्","meaning":"of all beings; of all creatures; of all that exists"},{"word":"अचरम्","meaning":"unmoving; static; that which does not move — the immovable Brahman"},{"word":"चरम्","meaning":"moving; dynamic; the moving creation; that which has motion"},{"word":"एव","meaning":"indeed; certainly; emphasizing the statement"},{"word":"सूक्ष्मत्वात्","meaning":"because of Its subtlety; due to Its infinitely fine nature; by reason of being the subtlest"},{"word":"अविज्ञेयम्","meaning":"incomprehensible; not knowable by ordinary means; beyond the grasp of mind and senses"},{"word":"दूर-स्थम्","meaning":"standing far away; distant; infinitely remote for those in ignorance"},{"word":"अन्तिके","meaning":"near; close; intimate; immediately present for those with wisdom"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Shri Krishna whispers the most intimate truth here: the God you search for across mountains and temples is within you, closer than your own heartbeat. Yet because of the veil of ego, He seems infinitely distant. 'Dūra-sthaṃ cāntike ca' — far for the one who looks outward, near for the one who looks within. He is outside every stone and star, and inside every thought and feeling. He is the stillness within all movement and the movement within all stillness. The more refined our inner life becomes, the closer He seems, until one day there is no distance at all.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents Brahman through a series of spatial and ontological paradoxes. 'Bahir antaś ca' — both inside and outside — addresses the apparent limitation of saying Brahman is 'within': It equally pervades the so-called 'exterior.' 'Acaram caram' — both static and dynamic — is the Advaita teaching that Brahman is the unchanged substratum of all change. The phrase 'sūkṣmatvāt avijñeyam' is crucial: Brahman is not incomprehensible due to complexity but due to ultimacy of subtlety — It is the most subtle subject, and the subject can never become an object of ordinary cognition. The famous Kaṭha Upaniṣad teaching resonates: 'aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān' — subtler than the subtle, greater than the great.","yogananda":"Scientists have not found God with telescopes pointed outward or microscopes pointed inward — because He is the very consciousness doing the looking. 'Sūkṣmatvāt avijñeyam' — too subtle for any instrument, too intimate for any distance. The mystic's journey is the reversal of the search: from looking out to looking in, from trying to grasp to learning to be still. When the mental turbulence subsides in deep meditation, what remains is not emptiness but the closest, most immediate Presence — always here, always now. 'Antike ca' — God is nearer to you than you are to yourself.","goyandka":"The verse describes the vibhu (all-pervading) nature of Brahman through three paradoxical pairs: inner/outer, static/moving, far/near. Śrī Madhvācārya notes that 'acaram' (unmoving) refers to Brahman's own immovable nature while 'caram' refers to Its appearing as moving creation. The epithet 'sūkṣmatvāt avijñeyam' is consistent with the Taittirīya Upaniṣad's teaching that Brahman is subtler than space (ākāśa). The 'dūra-stham / antike' duality was famously rendered by the Īśāvāsya Upaniṣad (mantra 5): 'tad dūre tad u antike' — that is far away; that is also near. Direct knowledge of Brahman requires the dissolution of the very subject-object duality that makes it seem distant."}},{"verse":16,"sanskrit":"अविभक्तं च भूतेषु विभक्तम् इव च स्थितम् । भूत-भर्तृ च तज् ज्ञेयं ग्रसिष्णु प्रभविष्णु च ॥","transliteration":"avibhaktam ca bhūteṣu vibhaktam iva ca sthitam | bhūta-bhartṛ ca tat jñeyam grasiṣṇu prabhaviṣṇu ca ||","translation":"And though undivided among beings, It appears as if divided; It is to be known as the supporter, the devourer, and the creator of all beings.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_16.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"अविभक्तम्","meaning":"undivided; without partition; indivisible; the one without any internal division"},{"word":"च","meaning":"and; also; both — the connective holding the paradox"},{"word":"भूतेषु","meaning":"among beings; in all creatures; within all that has come into existence"},{"word":"विभक्तम् इव","meaning":"as if divided; appearing to be divided; seemingly partitioned — the word 'iva' (like/as if) is crucial"},{"word":"स्थितम्","meaning":"situated; standing; abiding; existing in that apparent state of division"},{"word":"भूत-भर्तृ","meaning":"the supporter of all beings; the sustainer; the one who bears and maintains existence"},{"word":"तत् ज्ञेयम्","meaning":"that is to be known; that Brahman is to be understood thus"},{"word":"ग्रसिष्णु","meaning":"the devourer; the destroyer; Time (Kāla) that absorbs everything back into itself"},{"word":"प्रभविष्णु","meaning":"the creator; the source from which all emerges; the origin of all manifestation"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The seeming multiplicity of life — countless creatures, forms, names — is Brahman appearing as if divided, like one ocean sending up innumerable waves. The word 'iva' — 'as if' — is perhaps the most important word in this verse. Brahman is never actually divided; it only appears so. He is bhūta-bhartṛ — the loving Father who sustains every one of His children. He is grasiṣṇu — Time, which tenderly withdraws all forms back into Himself. And He is prabhaviṣṇu — the endlessly creative source, ever bringing forth new forms from His infinite abundance. He is the whole drama: creation, sustenance, and dissolution — all resting in His oneness.","sarvapriyananda":"The word 'iva' in 'vibhaktam iva' carries the entire weight of Advaita Vedānta. Brahman is not truly divided into the multiplicity of jīvas and objects — the division is apparent (vivartam), the product of Māyā. This is the key distinction between Advaita and Sāṃkhya: Sāṃkhya posits a real multiplicity of puruṣas; Advaita says there is one Brahman appearing as many. The three epithets — bhartṛ, grasiṣṇu, prabhaviṣṇu — correspond to Viṣṇu's triple function as the cosmic sustainer (sthiti), Śiva's function as the dissolver (laya), and Brahmā's function as the creator (sṛṣṭi). But all three inhere in the single Brahman being described.","yogananda":"One sunlight enters ten thousand windows and appears as ten thousand beams, yet it is one light. So Brahman enters all creatures and appears as innumerable individual souls — 'vibhaktam iva' — divided in appearance only. Every mystic tradition has touched this truth: 'Thou art That,' 'I and the Father are one,' 'Ahaṃ Brahmāsmi.' The three roles — creator, sustainer, devourer — are merely three faces of the one timeless Presence playing the cosmic game. To know this is to be released from the fear of death, because grasiṣṇu only 'devours' forms, never the eternal Self.","goyandka":"The philosophical crux of this verse lies in the word 'iva' (as if), which Śrī Śaṅkarācārya uses to anchor his Māyāvāda (doctrine of illusion): the division of Brahman is not real but apparent, produced by the upādhis (limiting conditions) of individual beings. Just as space appears divided when viewed through different pots, Brahman appears as multiple jīvas. The triad grasiṣṇu-prabhaviṣṇu-bhartṛ encapsulates the Vedic cosmological cycle: the universe periodically dissolves back into Brahman (pralaya) and emerges again (sṛṣṭi), while being sustained throughout (sthiti). This jñeyam — the knowable Brahman — encompasses the entire cycle without being affected by any of it."}},{"verse":17,"sanskrit":"ज्योतिषाम् अपि तज् ज्योतिस् तमसः परम् उच्यते । ज्ञानं ज्ञेयं ज्ञान-गम्यं हृदि सर्वस्य विष्ठितम् ॥","transliteration":"jyotiṣām api tat jyotiḥ tamasaḥ param ucyate | jñānam jñeyam jñāna-gamyam hṛdi sarvasya viṣṭhitam ||","translation":"That is the Light of lights, declared to be beyond darkness; It is knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of knowledge — seated in the heart of all.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_17.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"ज्योतिषाम्","meaning":"of lights; of all luminaries; of fire, sun, moon, stars — all sources of light"},{"word":"अपि","meaning":"even; also; including — emphasizing that Brahman illumines even other lights"},{"word":"तत् ज्योतिः","meaning":"that light; referring to Brahman as the Light of all lights"},{"word":"तमसः परम्","meaning":"beyond darkness; transcending tamas (ignorance); beyond the realm of nescience"},{"word":"उच्यते","meaning":"is declared; is said to be; is described thus"},{"word":"ज्ञानम्","meaning":"knowledge; here meaning Brahman as pure consciousness, the knower-aspect"},{"word":"ज्ञेयम्","meaning":"the object of knowledge; the known; Brahman as what is to be realized"},{"word":"ज्ञान-गम्यम्","meaning":"the goal of knowledge; that which is reached through knowledge; the ultimate destination of the knowing process"},{"word":"हृदि","meaning":"in the heart; in the cave of the heart (hṛdaya-guha); the innermost center of being"},{"word":"सर्वस्य","meaning":"of all; of every being without exception"},{"word":"विष्ठितम्","meaning":"seated; established; abiding; dwelling — as in a permanent, stable residence"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Of all the verses in this chapter, this one shines like the very thing it describes.

He has spoken of fields and knowers, wisdom qualities and the boundless Brahman — but notice how He concludes: 'My devotee, knowing this, reaches My state.' Not the philosopher's state, not the ascetic's state — My state. The synthesis is complete: true knowledge (jñāna) and true love (bhakti) are not rivals. The devotee who understands this teaching doesn't merely become wise — they become like the Beloved himself. Mad-bhāva is the ultimate homecoming: becoming one with the divine nature that was never really separate.","sarvapriyananda":"This summary verse is of great theological significance because of the word 'mad-bhakta.' Śrī Śaṅkara acknowledges that even within the jñāna-mārga, bhakti is the integrating factor — it is the devotee's orientation toward Brahman that makes the knowledge transformative rather than merely intellectual. 'Vijñāya' (having truly understood — experientially, not merely conceptually) is the operative word. Vijñāna in Vedāntic usage refers to the direct apprehension of truth (anubhava), distinguished from mere śravaṇa (hearing) or manana (reflection). The goal 'mad-bhāvāya upapadyate' is the Gītā's recurring description of liberation: not a remote heaven but the very nature (bhāva) of the Lord.","yogananda":"This verse illustrates that the Gītā never separates knowledge from devotion. True jñāna, when it deepens, inevitably becomes bhakti — for what is love but the recognition of one's own deepest nature in another? The devotee who understands the teaching of kṣetra and kṣetrajña, who penetrates the mystery of Brahman as the light of lights, does not remain a mere knower — they are transformed, elevated to mad-bhāva, the very state and nature of the Divine. This is liberation not as extinction but as expansion — the dropping of the small self into the infinite ocean of the Self.","goyandka":"This verse functions as the upa-saṃhāra (concluding summary) of the first major section of Chapter 13 (verses 1-18). The three topics — kṣetra, jñāna, and jñeyam — precisely correspond to the three opening questions asked by Arjuna (which are implicit in the structure): What is the field? What is true knowledge? What is to be known? Krishna has answered all three. The use of 'mad-bhakta' (My devotee) rather than 'jñānī' (knower) signals the Gītā's consistent position that pure jñāna and pure bhakti converge at the highest level. Mad-bhāva is liberation as identity with Brahman — sāyujya-mukti in the bhakti tradition, brahma-nirvāṇa in the jñāna tradition."}},{"verse":19,"sanskrit":"प्रकृतिं पुरुषं चैव विद्ध्य् अनादी उभाव् अपि । विकारांश् च गुणांश् चैव विद्धि प्रकृति-संभवान् ॥","transliteration":"prakṛtim puruṣam ca eva viddhi anādī ubhau api | vikārān ca guṇān ca eva viddhi prakṛti-sambhavān ||","translation":"Know that both Prakṛti and Puruṣa are beginningless; and know that the modifications (vikāras) and the guṇas are born of Prakṛti.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_19.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"प्रकृतिम्","meaning":"Prakṛti; primordial Nature; the material cause of the universe; the field of all manifestation"},{"word":"पुरुषम्","meaning":"Puruṣa; the conscious Self; the witness; the principle of pure awareness"},{"word":"च एव","meaning":"and also; both; indeed — emphasizing the pair together"},{"word":"विद्धि","meaning":"know; understand; realize — the imperative addressed to Arjuna and all seekers"},{"word":"अनादी","meaning":"beginningless; without a starting point; both having existed from eternity"},{"word":"उभौ अपि","meaning":"both; both of them; each without exception"},{"word":"विकारान्","meaning":"modifications; transformations; the twenty-four tattvas of Sāṃkhya that evolve from Prakṛti"},{"word":"गुणान्","meaning":"the three guṇas — sattva, rajas, and tamas; the fundamental qualities of Prakṛti"},{"word":"च एव","meaning":"and also; and indeed"},{"word":"प्रकृति-सम्भवान्","meaning":"born of Prakṛti; having Prakṛti as their source and cause; arising from primordial Nature"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Shri Krishna now opens a new vista, shifting from the description of Brahman to the practical teaching of how the soul becomes entangled in the world. Two great principles exist: Prakṛti — the vast creative energy of Nature, ceaselessly transforming — and Puruṣa — the still, luminous witness-Self. Both are beginningless; neither was created from something prior. All the guṇas, all the vikāras — the entire drama of creation — spring from Prakṛti alone. Puruṣa simply witnesses. Understanding this distinction is the first step toward freedom: I am the witness, not the witnessed; the knower, not the known.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse begins the third major prakaraṇa (section) of Chapter 13 — the Sāṃkhya-Yoga exposition on Prakṛti and Puruṣa, which runs through verse 23. The statement that both Prakṛti and Puruṣa are 'anādi' (beginningless) diverges from pure Advaita, where only Brahman is ultimately real and Prakṛti has no ultimate ontological status. From the vyāvahārika (empirical) perspective, however, both are accepted as beginningless — this is the teaching level appropriate for Arjuna's understanding. The twenty-four tattvas of Sāṃkhya (mahat, ahaṅkāra, five tanmātras, five mahābhūtas, ten indriyas, manas) are all 'vikāras' — modifications — of Prakṛti.","yogananda":"The spiritual seeker must understand these two fundamental principles: consciousness (Puruṣa) and energy (Prakṛti). God created the universe through the interplay of His consciousness and His creative power. You as a soul are Puruṣa — pure, unchanging awareness. The body, mind, senses, and all that changes is Prakṛti. When you mistakenly identify as Prakṛti — as the body, the emotions, the thoughts — you feel bound. When you rest in your true Puruṣa-nature — the still witness within — you are free.

All except Puruṣa and Prakṛti are vikāras of Prakṛti. The Gītā integrates this Sāṃkhya framework within its theistic vision: Puruṣa here is not one of many (as in classical Sāṃkhya) but ultimately the one supreme Puruṣa, Paramātman. 'Anādī ubhāv api' — the beginninglessness of both is asserted at the empirical level; at the paramārtika level, only Brahman is eternal.

Prakṛti acts — she is the great doer, the producer of all causes and effects, the weaver of the body, the sharpener of the mind. Puruṣa experiences — he is the one who feels pleasure and pain, joy and grief. Now see the subtlety: Puruṣa is actually a pure witness, but because he identifies with Prakṛti's activities, he thinks 'I am experiencing, I am suffering, I am enjoying.' Liberation is when Puruṣa recognizes: 'I am not the doer; I am not the sufferer; I am the eternal witness.' This single recognition can end lifetimes of bondage in a single moment of grace.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse establishes the Sāṃkhya-Yoga categorical distinction between Prakṛti as kartā (doer) and Puruṣa as bhoktā (experiencer). From the strict Sāṃkhya standpoint, both kartṛtva and bhoktṛtva are ultimately illusory: Prakṛti acts but has no consciousness to actually 'do'; Puruṣa is conscious but immovable, so it cannot actually 'experience.' It is the confused association (saṃyoga) between the two that creates the appearance of an agent-experiencer. The Yoga of discrimination — viveka-khyāti — consists in seeing that 'Prakṛti acts' and 'Puruṣa witnesses' and never the twain shall truly meet. This clarity dissolves the sense of bondage.","yogananda":"Every experience of pleasure and pain happens in the body and nervous system — in Prakṛti — and is registered by the mind. But the soul (Puruṣa) in its pure nature is only the witness. When we identify with the body, we think 'I am in pain.' When we identify with the mind, we think 'I am anxious.' But step back into the awareness that simply watches — and there is no pain, no anxiety, only pure witnessing. This is the practice of Sāṃkhya, and it is the deepest yoga: disidentify from all that changes (Prakṛti) and rest in the unchanging awareness (Puruṣa). This is what Patañjali calls kaivalya — the aloneness of pure consciousness.","goyandka":"The verse draws the Sāṃkhya distinction between the two aspects of causation: Prakṛti is the nimittopādāna-kāraṇa (the instrumental and material cause) for all kāryas (effects such as body, world) and kāraṇas (instruments such as senses, mind). Puruṣa is neither cause nor actor in the Sāṃkhya sense, but its proximity to Prakṛti creates the adhyāsa (superimposition) by which the pure witness appears as bhoktā. Śrī Śaṅkara uses this verse to show that bondage is rooted in the false identification of Puruṣa with Prakṛti's modifications. Liberation (mukti) is the cessation of this false association — not a new achievement but the recognition of what was always the case: Puruṣa was never truly bound, never truly a bhoktā."}},{"verse":21,"sanskrit":"पुरुषः प्रकृति-स्थो हि भुङ्क्ते प्रकृति-जान् गुणान् । कारणं गुण-सङ्गोऽस्य सद्-असद्-योनि-जन्मसु ॥","transliteration":"puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān | kāraṇaṃ guṇa-saṅgo'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu ||","translation":"Indeed, the Puruṣa, seated in (identified with) Prakṛti, experiences the guṇas born of Prakṛti.

This apparent enjoyership — bhoktṛtva — is the root of saṃsāra.

Guṇa-saṅga is this magnetic attachment, the subtle gravity that pulls consciousness into embodied life again and again. Each desire-seed planted in the soil of Nature grows into a new birth. The teaching here is deeply practical: cease feeding these attachments through non-attachment and meditation, and the cycles of reincarnation gradually lose their power. We are not the actors in this cosmic drama — we are the watching Light.","goyandka":"The Puruṣa, though ever-free and without beginning or modification, appears — through the conjunction with Prakṛti — to experience the guṇas of sattva, rajas, and tamas that Prakṛti produces. This apparent experiencing is not real modification of the Puruṣa but a seeming (ābhāsa) caused by non-discrimination. Guṇa-saṅga, the sense of 'I am this guṇa, I feel this pleasure or pain,' is declared to be the precise cause of birth in auspicious (sat) and inauspicious (asat) wombs. The discriminating student must understand that the Puruṣa is always beyond the guṇas, and identify accordingly."}},{"verse":22,"sanskrit":"उपद्रष्टानुमन्ता च भर्ता भोक्ता महेश्वरः । परमात्मेति चाप्य् उक्तो देहेऽस्मिन् पुरुषः परः ॥","transliteration":"upadraṣṭā anumantā ca bhartā bhoktā maheśvaraḥ | paramātmā iti ca api uktaḥ dehe asmin puruṣaḥ paraḥ ||","translation":"The Supreme Puruṣa in this body is the witness (upadraṣṭā), the permitter (anumantā), the sustainer (bhartā), the experiencer (bhoktā), the Great Lord (Maheśvara) — also called the Paramātman, the Supreme Self.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_22.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"उपद्रष्टा","meaning":"the witness, the seer standing near"},{"word":"अनुमन्ता","meaning":"the permitter, the consenter, the sanctioner"},{"word":"भर्ता","meaning":"the sustainer, the upholder"},{"word":"भोक्ता","meaning":"the experiencer, the apparent enjoyer"},{"word":"महेश्वरः","meaning":"the Great Lord, the Supreme Ruler"},{"word":"परमात्मा","meaning":"the Supreme Self, the highest Ātman"},{"word":"इति","meaning":"thus, so called"},{"word":"च अपि उक्तः","meaning":"is also described / called"},{"word":"देहे अस्मिन्","meaning":"in this body"},{"word":"पुरुषः परः","meaning":"the Supreme Puruṣa, the transcendent Person"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"What grace that the Lord Himself dwells within this very body as our witness, our sustainer, our Supreme Self!

To simply remember this, to pause in one's daily life and inwardly bow to this indwelling Lord, is itself a profound sādhanā. He is always here; we need only turn within.","sarvapriyananda":"This luminous verse introduces five epithets of the Paramātman as the Antaryāmin, the inner ruler. As upadraṣṭā, the Supreme Self is pure witnessing awareness — never involved, never modified. As anumantā, it appears to 'permit' actions without actually doing them — the light of consciousness that illumines all mental activity. As bhartā and bhoktā these suggest only apparent functions, not real doership. Maheśvara and Paramātman signal that this indwelling Self is identical with the Supreme Brahman. Advaita sees no ultimate distinction between the Paramātman in the body and the infinite Brahman — only superimposition creates the appearance of individual jīvas.","yogananda":"God has not abandoned us to the solitary darkness of this physical world — He is present as the Paramātman, the Cosmic Consciousness cradled within our own hearts. As the witness (upadraṣṭā), He watches our every dream and delusion with infinite patience and love, waiting for us to turn inward. As the permitter (anumantā), He grants us the freedom of free will even when we misuse it. As sustainer and Great Lord, the entire creation is upheld by His presence alone. To contact this indwelling Presence through deep meditation is the supreme purpose of human life — all other goals are secondary.","goyandka":"The Lord here precisely defines the nature of the Supreme Puruṣa present within the body. Five distinct designations are given: upadraṣṭā — one who witnesses without being involved; anumantā — one who sanctions actions without performing them, maintaining full freedom; bhartā — the sustainer of the jīva and cosmos; bhoktā — apparent experiencer of the results of actions (though in reality the Paramātman does not truly enjoy); and Maheśvara — the supreme overlord of all Prakṛti. The term Paramātman distinguishes the Supreme Self (in the body) from the individual self (jīvātman) and from Prakṛti, firmly establishing the transcendent ground of existence."}},{"verse":23,"sanskrit":"य एवं वेत्ति पुरुषं प्रकृतिं च गुणैः सह । सर्वथा वर्तमानोऽपि न स भूयोऽभिजायते ॥","transliteration":"yaḥ evaṃ vetti puruṣaṃ prakṛtiṃ ca guṇaiḥ saha | sarvathā vartamānaḥ api na saḥ bhūyaḥ abhijāyate ||","translation":"He who thus knows the Puruṣa and Prakṛti together with the guṇas — in whatever manner he exists, he is not born again.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_23.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यः","meaning":"he who"},{"word":"एवं वेत्ति","meaning":"knows thus, understands in this way"},{"word":"पुरुषम्","meaning":"the Puruṣa, pure consciousness"},{"word":"प्रकृतिम् च","meaning":"and Prakṛti, Nature"},{"word":"गुणैः सह","meaning":"together with the guṇas"},{"word":"सर्वथा","meaning":"in every way, regardless of circumstance"},{"word":"वर्तमानः","meaning":"existing, living, abiding"},{"word":"अपि","meaning":"even, though"},{"word":"न","meaning":"not"},{"word":"सः","meaning":"he, that person"},{"word":"भूयः अभिजायते","meaning":"is born again, takes rebirth"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"This is the Lord's direct promise: know the Puruṣa, know Prakṛti, understand the play of the guṇas — and you shall not be born again into this cycle of suffering.

The liberation is internal, not dependent on outward circumstances. This knowledge does not require a particular lifestyle; it requires a transformed vision. Let that vision be your constant prayer and pursuit, dear one.","sarvapriyananda":"Liberation (mokṣa) is the direct result of vijñāna — the discriminative knowledge of Puruṣa, Prakṛti, and the three guṇas. The phrase 'sarvathā vartamānaḥ api' is striking: even while continuing to live in the world in any manner, the jñānī is no longer bound. This is the Vedantic understanding of jīvanmukti — liberation while living. The body may continue its natural course, prārabdha karma playing out, but no new karma accumulates and no new birth is generated. The rope has been recognized as the rope; the snake-appearance dissolves forever.","yogananda":"True knowledge liberates — not book knowledge, but the living, experiential realization of the Puruṣa as the eternal Self and Prakṛti as the ever-changing phenomenal world. When this realization dawns, the soul is freed from the magnetic compulsion to reincarnate. 'Sarvathā vartamānaḥ api' — the liberated one may appear to live as any ordinary person, engaged in daily duties, but inwardly they move through life like a lotus untouched by the muddy water in which it blooms. Their karma is spent; no new seeds are planted; the cycle of birth and death comes to its natural and final close.","goyandka":"The fruit of the entire teaching of kṣetra, kṣetrajña, jñāna, jñeyam, Prakṛti, and Puruṣa is stated here with finality: he who knows all this in its proper relationship — the distinction between the experiencing Puruṣa and the experienced Prakṛti-with-guṇas — is never reborn. The qualifier 'sarvathā vartamānaḥ' is carefully placed to remove the misconception that liberation requires renunciation of all activity. The knowledge itself, when complete, is the liberating factor, and it functions regardless of the external station of life the jñānī happens to inhabit."}},{"verse":24,"sanskrit":"ध्यानेनात्मनि पश्यन्ति केचिद् आत्मानम् आत्मना । अन्ये सांख्येन योगेन कर्म-योगेन चापरे ॥","transliteration":"dhyānena ātmani paśyanti kecit ātmānam ātmanā | anye sāṃkhyena yogena karma-yogena ca apare ||","translation":"Some see the Self within themselves through meditation on the Self, by the Self; others through the path of Sāṃkhya (knowledge/discrimination), and still others through Karma Yoga (the yoga of action).","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_24.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"ध्यानेन","meaning":"through meditation, through contemplation"},{"word":"आत्मनि","meaning":"in the Self, within oneself"},{"word":"पश्यन्ति","meaning":"they see, they perceive"},{"word":"केचित्","meaning":"some (people)"},{"word":"आत्मानम्","meaning":"the Self, the Ātman (object of seeing)"},{"word":"आत्मना","meaning":"by the Self, through the Self (instrument of seeing)"},{"word":"अन्ये","meaning":"others"},{"word":"सांख्येन योगेन","meaning":"through the yoga of Sāṃkhya, discriminative knowledge"},{"word":"कर्म-योगेन","meaning":"through the yoga of selfless action"},{"word":"च अपरे","meaning":"and yet others, still others"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The Lord's compassion shines here: He does not prescribe one single rigid path for all seekers, for He knows the infinite variety of His children's temperaments.

All roads, traveled with sincerity and love, lead to the same destination. Find the path that resonates with your own nature and walk it wholeheartedly.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is one of the Gīta's grand reconciling statements. The three paths mentioned correspond broadly to Rāja Yoga (dhyāna), Jñāna Yoga (Sāṃkhya), and Karma Yoga — and Bhakti is implied in the devotional tenor of the whole teaching. The phrase 'ātmanā ātmānam' is particularly significant to Advaita Vedānta: the Self seeing the Self by the Self. There is no external mediator, no 'other' to perceive the Self — pure Consciousness is both the perceiver and the perceived. This reflexive self-luminosity of Brahman is the heart of the Upanishadic revelation.","yogananda":"The great masters of all traditions have taught that there are many rivers but one ocean. Here Kṛṣṇa confirms this with divine authority. The meditator who stills the mind and plunges into the inner silence, the philosopher who relentlessly questions 'Who am I?', and the karma yogi who offers every action as worship — all three are climbing the same mountain from different sides. Dhyāna yoga is Kṛṣṇa's own recommendation for this age: in the stillness of deep meditation, the meditator, the act of meditation, and the object of meditation — the Self — merge into one undivided Awareness.","goyandka":"The Lord here acknowledges the diversity of qualified seekers and the variety of paths appropriate to their temperaments. Dhyāna yoga suits the mind that can withdraw from sense objects and fix itself steadily on the formless Self. Sāṃkhya yoga, or jñāna yoga in its discriminative aspect, suits those of sharp intellectual discernment who can analytically distinguish Puruṣa from Prakṛti. Karma yoga suits those whose nature inclines toward action, who purify the antaḥkaraṇa through dedicated selfless service.

Do not ever feel disqualified from liberation because you cannot sit in long meditation or master complex philosophy. Simply listen with an open, devoted heart to the words of the Lord and the guru, and the same shore will be reached.","sarvapriyananda":"This is perhaps the most inclusive verse in Chapter 13. After describing the paths of meditation, Sāṃkhya analysis, and Karma Yoga, Kṛṣṇa now acknowledges a fourth class: those who simply hear from qualified teachers and faithfully practice. 'Śruti-parāyaṇāḥ' — those who take śruti (scripture and the guru's transmitted word) as their supreme refuge. The tradition of guru-śiṣya paramparā is sanctified here. Even without direct realization in this life, earnest listening and sincere practice plants seeds that will bear fruit. The word 'eva' — 'indeed' — is the Lord's emphatic assurance that this path is not inferior.","yogananda":"The divine law of Grace makes provision even for those who have not yet awakened their inner capacities for meditation or discrimination. Such souls need only surrender to the living truth they hear from an illumined teacher, practicing with sincere devotion whatever they understand. The sacred scriptures are the crystallized experience of the masters; to absorb oneself in them with faith is to receive their blessings directly. Many devotees on the path of bhakti belong to this category — they may not be philosophers or advanced meditators, yet their loving receptivity to the guru's words becomes a raft that carries them across the sea of death.","goyandka":"Having described three paths suited to advanced adhikārīs, the Lord here shows His universal compassion by addressing those of lesser qualification (mandādhikārīs). Such persons neither possess the mental steadiness for sustained dhyāna, nor the sharp discrimination for Sāṃkhya analysis, nor have they fully committed to karma yoga. For these also, a path exists: to hear the teachings from qualified ācāryas and upāsate — to practice accordingly with sincerity and faith. Even they — the 'te api' is emphatic — cross beyond the bondage of mortality. The sole requirement is śruti-parāyaṇatā, genuine devotion to what is heard from scripture and teacher."}},{"verse":26,"sanskrit":"यावत् सञ्जायते किञ्चित् सत्त्वं स्थावर-जङ्गमम् । क्षेत्र-क्षेत्रज्ञ-संयोगात् तद् विद्धि भरतर्षभ ॥","transliteration":"yāvat sañjāyate kiñcit sattvam sthāvara-jaṅgamam | kṣetra-kṣetrajña-saṃyogāt tat viddhi bharatarṣabha ||","translation":"Whatever being is born — moving or unmoving — know that to be from the union of kṣetra (field/body) and kṣetrajña (knower of field), O Best of the Bharatas.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_26.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यावत्","meaning":"whatever, as much as, all that"},{"word":"सञ्जायते","meaning":"is born, comes into existence"},{"word":"किञ्चित्","meaning":"anything, any being whatsoever"},{"word":"सत्त्वम्","meaning":"being, entity, creature"},{"word":"स्थावर","meaning":"unmoving, stationary (plants, minerals)"},{"word":"जङ्गमम्","meaning":"moving, animate (animals, humans)"},{"word":"क्षेत्र-क्षेत्रज्ञ-संयोगात्","meaning":"from the union/conjunction of the field and the knower of the field"},{"word":"तत् विद्धि","meaning":"know that, understand that"},{"word":"भरतर्षभ","meaning":"O Best of the Bharatas (Arjuna)"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"The Lord gives Arjuna — and us — a master key to understand all of existence: every single thing that is born, from a tiny blade of grass to a towering mountain, from an ant to the Creator Himself, is the union of kṣetra and kṣetrajña, matter and consciousness. There is no exception in all creation. This understanding dissolves the confusion that separates 'the spiritual' from 'the material.' Everything is sacred because everything is this divine union. When we look at any being with this understanding, we see the Lord's own creative play, and wonder and reverence arise naturally in our hearts.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the ontological linchpin of Chapter 13. Every manifest entity — from the smallest blade of grass (sthāvara) to the most evolved human (jaṅgama) — is the conjunction of Prakṛti (kṣetra) and Puruṣa (kṣetrajña). This is the Sāṃkhya-Vedānta synthesis: Brahman manifests as the world through the appearance of this conjunction. There is no 'dead matter' in this view — every stone, every tree, every atom participates in Consciousness. Śaṅkara reads kṣetrajña here as the reflected consciousness (cidābhāsa) that animates every particular form, while the one Paramātman remains the ultimate ground.","yogananda":"Creation is the cosmic dance of Spirit and Matter — Puruṣa and Prakṛti, kṣetrajña and kṣetra. Every living being is a knot where these two infinite realities meet and embrace. The plant that reaches toward sunlight, the animal that feels joy and pain, the human being who aspires toward God — all are manifestations of this one grand union. The sage who sees this does not look at any being with contempt or indifference; for in every creature they behold the same Consciousness-in-Matter that they recognize as their own deepest Self. This is the basis of the compassion and reverence of truly illumined souls.","goyandka":"Having established in the preceding verses that kṣetra is the material body-world and kṣetrajña is the witnessing Puruṣa, the Lord now applies this framework universally. No being in the entire range of creation — from the immovable mineral and plant (sthāvara) to the mobile animal and human (jaṅgama) — falls outside this principle. All arise from the conjunction (saṃyoga) of these two. This is not merely a philosophical proposition but a practical key for the sādhaka: seeing any being as this union prevents the errors of both pure materialism (ignoring the kṣetrajña) and pure idealism that denies the kṣetra's conditional reality."}},{"verse":27,"sanskrit":"समं सर्वेषु भूतेषु तिष्ठन्तं परमेश्वरम् । विनश्यत्सु अविनश्यन्तं यः पश्यति स पश्यति ॥","transliteration":"samam sarveṣu bhūteṣu tiṣṭhantam parameśvaram | vinaśyatsu avinaśyantam yaḥ paśyati saḥ paśyati ||","translation":"He who sees the Supreme Lord equally dwelling in all beings — the imperishable within the perishable — he truly sees.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_27.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"समम्","meaning":"equally, without distinction, uniformly"},{"word":"सर्वेषु भूतेषु","meaning":"in all beings, in every creature"},{"word":"तिष्ठन्तम्","meaning":"dwelling, abiding, established"},{"word":"परमेश्वरम्","meaning":"the Supreme Lord, the Highest Ruler"},{"word":"विनश्यत्सु","meaning":"in the perishable, among those that are destroyed"},{"word":"अविनश्यन्तम्","meaning":"the imperishable, that which is not destroyed"},{"word":"यः पश्यति","meaning":"he who sees, whoever perceives"},{"word":"सः पश्यति","meaning":"he truly sees, that one really sees"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Sa paśyati — he truly sees!

In the saint and in the sinner, in the flower and in the stone, in the child and in the elder — the same Parameśvara is dwelling, unchanging. When this vision opens, hatred becomes impossible, for hatred requires seeing someone as 'other,' and to the true seer, there is no other. Practice this seeing in your daily life: before each encounter, remember — the Lord is here too.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse defines darśana — true spiritual vision — in unambiguous terms. The realized one perceives the Parameśvara, the Supreme Consciousness, as equally present (samam) in all beings without exception. 'Vinaśyatsu avinaśyantam' — the Imperishable dwells within the perishable; the Infinite within the finite; the Eternal within the temporal. This is the Vedantic vision of Brahman as the inner Self of all (sarvāntaryāmin). The doubling of 'paśyati' — 'yaḥ paśyati sa paśyati' — is the śāstra's way of distinguishing between mere ocular perception and the spiritual seeing that constitutes genuine enlightenment.","yogananda":"The saints and sages of all traditions who attained this vision describe the same ineffable experience: God shining equally in all things, in all beings, without exception. This is not sentiment but direct perception — the opening of what Kṛṣṇa elsewhere calls the jñāna-cakṣus, the eye of wisdom. When this eye opens, ordinary vision is not lost but transformed: we continue to perceive diversity of forms, but simultaneously we behold the One Light that animates all forms. This is 'vinaśyatsu avinaśyantam' — the undying Light seen clearly within all dying things.

True seeing consists in perceiving the Parameśvara — the Supreme Self — as uniform (sama) and equally present in all beings, from the most elevated to the most humble.

'Na hinasty ātmanātmānam' — the lower self no longer wounds the higher Self through harmful thoughts, words, or deeds directed at any being. Ahiṃsā becomes not a moral rule to follow with effort, but a natural expression of what we have seen. And the Lord promises: because of this seeing and this natural harmlessness, one goes to parā gati — the Supreme Goal. Vision leads to virtue; virtue leads to the highest attainment.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse reveals the ethical consequence of Vedantic vision. 'Ātmanā ātmānam na hinasti' — one does not injure the (higher) Self through the (lower) self. When one sees Brahman everywhere, the ego-self (which is the instrument of harm) loses its identification with the limited body-mind and ceases to generate the ignorance-born impulses of violence, greed, and hatred. This is the Advaitic grounding of ethics: morality flows naturally from correct metaphysical vision, not from external rules alone. 'Parā gati' — the Supreme Goal — is Brahman-realization itself, the natural destination of one who lives this unified vision.","yogananda":"To truly see God in all things is to be incapable of causing real harm — for harm requires the illusion of separation, the belief that there is an 'other' separate from oneself. The sage who perceives the one Ātman everywhere moves through the world as a blessing to all beings, and the world opens itself to such a one in return. 'Na hinasty ātmanātmānam' describes not merely the absence of physical violence but the dissolution of all internal violence — the violence of judgment, condemnation, and rejection of any being. From this state of total inner peace and universal acceptance, the path to the Supreme Goal becomes straight and swift.","goyandka":"The logic of this verse is carefully constructed. Because (hi) one sees the Parameśvara equally established everywhere, the individual self (ātmā in the instrumental case — lower self, mind-intellect-ego complex) does not injure the higher Self (ātmānam — the Paramātman present in all). When every being is seen as the Lord's own form, actions of body, mind, and speech naturally align with dharma, and no harm is generated toward any being or toward one's own higher nature. The result, stated with finality, is parā gati — the attainment of the Supreme state that is the ultimate purpose of human birth."}},{"verse":29,"sanskrit":"प्रकृत्यैव च कर्माणि क्रियमाणानि सर्वशः । यः पश्यति तथात्मानम् अकर्तारं स पश्यति ॥","transliteration":"prakṛtyā eva ca karmāṇi kriyamāṇāni sarvaśaḥ | yaḥ paśyati tathā ātmānam akartāram saḥ paśyati ||","translation":"He who sees that all actions are performed by Prakṛti alone in every way, and that the Self (Ātman) is the non-doer (akartā) — he truly sees.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_29.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"प्रकृत्या एव","meaning":"by Prakṛti alone, by Nature itself"},{"word":"च","meaning":"and, also"},{"word":"कर्माणि","meaning":"actions, activities"},{"word":"क्रियमाणानि","meaning":"being performed, being done (passive present participle)"},{"word":"सर्वशः","meaning":"in every way, completely, entirely"},{"word":"यः पश्यति","meaning":"he who sees"},{"word":"तथा","meaning":"likewise, also, in the same way"},{"word":"आत्मानम्","meaning":"the Self, the Ātman"},{"word":"अकर्तारम्","meaning":"the non-doer, not the agent of action"},{"word":"सः पश्यति","meaning":"he truly sees"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"What a liberating truth! The Self — your true Self — is akartā, the non-doer. It never acts, never gets stained, never accumulates karma. All actions belong entirely to Prakṛti — to the body, the senses, the prāṇa, the mind, the guṇas. When this is seen clearly, the crushing burden of personal doership falls away. We no longer say 'I did this' or 'I must do that' in the egoic sense; we become instruments through which the divine Prakṛti works according to her own laws, while the witnessing Self remains ever free and pure. This insight, dear one, is the doorway to lasting peace.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse is the companion to verse 27 and completes the two-fold vision of the jñānī. In v27, the realization is 'I see the Lord equally in all beings.' Here the realization is 'All actions belong to Prakṛti; the Ātman is akartā.' Together these constitute the full Vedantic vision. The Ātman does not act — it is pure Consciousness, ever the witness. Śaṅkarācārya explains: the appearance of doership arises from the superimposition (adhyāsa) of the activities of the antaḥkaraṇa onto the pure Ātman. When this superimposition is removed through discrimination, the Ātman stands revealed in its pristine akartā nature. This is the liberating knowledge.","yogananda":"Once the meditator deeply contacts the inner witness — the still, silent Puruṣa at the center of their being — they realize with a shock of recognition: 'I was never the doer!' All the anxious striving, all the pride and shame associated with actions, was mistaken identity. The body acts through its guṇas; the mind thinks through its conditioning; Prakṛti performs her endless dance. But the Self stands apart — untouched, unstained, luminous. This realization does not lead to inaction but to effortless action, for when the ego-doer steps back, the divine intelligence of Prakṛti flows unobstructed, and actions become perfectly aligned with the higher will.","goyandka":"The statement 'prakṛtyaiva karmāṇi kriyamāṇāni sarvaśaḥ' is absolute: in every respect, without any exception, all actions are performed by Prakṛti alone. The Ātman is akartā — completely free of doership, agency, and consequently free of the fruits of action (phala). Doership (kartṛtva) belongs to ahaṃkāra, which is a product of Prakṛti; it is incorrectly superimposed on the Ātman through ignorance.

When one clearly sees that all the multiplicity of beings — all their apparent separateness and individuality — rests in the One, and that this very multiplicity flows out from that One alone, then Brahman is attained. Not approached, not glimpsed, but sampadyate — fully attained. This is not a distant future promise; it is the immediate fruit of this clear seeing. The One becomes the Many without ceasing to be One; the Many are always already the One. When this paradox is not just understood intellectually but directly seen, the drop recognizes that it has always been the ocean.","sarvapriyananda":"This crowning verse of the Puruṣa-Prakṛti teaching describes the summit experience of non-dual realization. 'Bhūta-pṛthag-bhāvam eka-stham' — the entire diversity of creation is seen to be established in the One (eka), not separate from it. 'Tata eva ca vistāram' — and this very diversity is the expansion of that One alone. Both the 'rest' of multiplicity in unity and the 'expansion' of unity into multiplicity are simultaneously perceived. This is the pūrṇa-anubhava, the integral experience described in the Māṇḍūkya Upaniṣad and the Brahmasūtras. 'Brahma sampadyate' — the realization is not merely cognitive but a full ontological attainment: one becomes Brahman.","yogananda":"In the highest state of samādhi, the meditator perceives this truth directly: all individual forms and beings are waves on the one infinite ocean of Brahman-Consciousness. The waves have different sizes, shapes, and movements — this is the bhūta-pṛthag-bhāva, the apparent separateness. But each wave is entirely water; it arises from water, rests in water, and returns to water. 'Brahma sampadyate' — the meditator does not merely think about Brahman; they become Brahman in their realization, recognizing that they were always and only Brahman, just as the wave is always and only the ocean. This is the final freedom: complete, permanent, unconditional.","goyandka":"This verse states the condition and the fruit of the highest realization. The condition: 'yadā anupaśyati' — when one directly perceives, not merely infers. What is perceived? That all the apparent separateness of beings (bhūta-pṛthag-bhāva) rests in the One (eka-stham), and that from that same One the entire expansion of manifestation proceeds. This is the vision of simultaneous unity-in-diversity and diversity-in-unity, which transcends the dualistic view that posits either creation as real and separate from Brahman, or creation as completely unreal. The fruit: 'brahma sampadyate' — Brahman is fully attained.

It is anādi, without beginning, which means it was never born into limitation; it is nirguṇa, beyond all qualities, which means no experience in the world of guṇas can color it. Though this radiant Paramātman lives within the body as its innermost witness, it stands apart like a lamp that illumines a room without being stained by what happens in that room. 'Na karoti na lipyate' — does not act, is not stained — these four words hold the key to all liberation. Rest in this recognition, dear one: your truest Self is already free.","sarvapriyananda":"This verse presents the central Advaita Vedānta argument for the Ātman's absolute purity: the two reasons given — anāditvāt (beginninglessness) and nirguṇatvāt (attributelessness) — are not merely descriptive but logically sufficient to establish non-doership and non-taintability. If there is no beginning, there is no causal chain through which karma can attach; if there are no guṇas, there is no medium through which the modes of Prakṛti can operate. The apparent embodiment (śarīra-sthaḥ) is a superimposition due to avidyā — just as one mistakenly attributes redness to a crystal placed near a red flower. The Paramātman is ayam — 'this' — the ever-present witness-consciousness, and the recognition 'I am this' dissolves all sense of doership and bondage in an instant.","yogananda":"The great Paramātman is not a distant God but the very Light behind your eyes and the Silence beneath your thoughts — beginningless because It never entered time, nirguṇa because It transcends the vibratory nature of creation. The body is like an intricate instrument through which Cosmic Consciousness plays, yet just as electricity is not diminished or changed by passing through countless bulbs, the Self is not altered by the countless experiences it witnesses through the body-mind. 'Na karoti na lipyate' points to the soul's essential nature in samādhi — where one directly experiences that one has never truly acted or been bound, that all activity belonged only to Prakṛti's dance. This verse is an invitation to shift your identity inward from the dancer to the witnessing Stillness that is eternally untouched, eternally pure, eternally free.","goyandka":"Śrī Bhagavān here establishes the philosophical basis for the Ātman's non-involvement through two irrefutable reasons. First, anāditvāt: that which has no beginning is not subject to origination, and that which is not originated cannot be subjected to bondage or modification — karma requires a starting point, and the Ātman has none. Second, nirguṇatvāt: action (karma) arises from the interplay of the three guṇas within Prakṛti; that which is beyond the guṇas has no instruments of action and no medium of contamination. The avyayaḥ — imperishable — nature of Paramātman confirms its absolute immutability. 'Śarīra-sthaḥ api' acknowledges the apparent contradiction (how can the indwelling witness be uninvolved?) and resolves it decisively: proximity and permeation are not participation. The disciple must hold this distinction firmly in viveka (discriminative understanding) to progress toward liberation."}},{"verse":32,"sanskrit":"यथा सर्व-गतं सौक्ष्म्याद् आकाशं नोपलिप्यते ।\\nसर्वत्रावस्थितो देहे तथात्मा नोपलिप्यते ॥","transliteration":"yathā sarva-gataṃ saukṣmyāt ākāśaṃ na upalipyate |\\nsarvatra avasthitaḥ dehe tathā ātmā na upalipyate ||","translation":"As the all-pervading ether is not tainted — because of its subtlety — so the Self, present everywhere within the body, is not tainted.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_32.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यथा","meaning":"just as, in the same way that; introduces the analogical reasoning (dṛṣṭānta)"},{"word":"सर्व-गतम्","meaning":"all-pervading, going everywhere; sarva = all, gata = gone/pervading; omnipresent without exception"},{"word":"सौक्ष्म्यात्","meaning":"because of subtlety; sūkṣma = subtle/fine; the ablative indicates this subtlety as the reason for non-taintability"},{"word":"आकाशम्","meaning":"ether, space, sky; the subtlest of the five great elements (pañca-mahābhūtas), pervading all others"},{"word":"न उपलिप्यते","meaning":"is not tainted, not smeared; upa = towards/upon, lip = to smear; despite intimate contact, no staining occurs"},{"word":"सर्वत्र","meaning":"everywhere, in all places; the Self is not merely in some bodies but equally present in every body without distinction"},{"word":"अवस्थितः","meaning":"situated, established, abiding; thoroughly present and pervading — not merely touching but fully pervading"},{"word":"देहे","meaning":"in the body; locative singular; within this particular body (and by extension, all bodies)"},{"word":"तथा","meaning":"so, in the same way; the conclusion of the analogy — what is true of ākāśa is true of Ātman"},{"word":"आत्मा","meaning":"the Self; pure Consciousness, the witness; Ātman as the indwelling knower of the field (kṣetrajña)"},{"word":"सूक्ष्म","meaning":"subtle; subtler than the subtlest element; Ātman is beyond even ākāśa in its fineness, hence even less susceptible to taint"},{"word":"उपलिप्यते","meaning":"becomes smeared/tainted; the verbal form emphasizes a process of gradual contamination — which simply does not occur for Ātman"},{"word":"सर्व-गत","meaning":"one whose nature is to pervade all; omnipresence here is not merely spatial but ontological — the ground of all existence"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Bhagavān now gives us the most tender and beautiful analogy — ākāśa, the open sky, the element of space. Think of how the sky holds within itself the smoke of fires, the dust of storms, the perfumes of flowers, the cries of birds — it holds all, yet it is stained by none. In this very same way, our beloved Self pervades every cell of this body, every flicker of every thought, every surge of every emotion, yet remains forever luminous and spotless. The word 'saukṣmyāt' — because of its subtlety — is so precious: it is precisely because Ātman is more subtle than the mind, more subtle than the senses, more subtle than even space itself, that nothing in the gross realm can cling to it. Sit quietly, beloved seeker, and feel that open spaciousness within — that is your truest address.","sarvapriyananda":"The ākāśa analogy (ākāśa-dṛṣṭānta) appears across the Upaniṣads — in the Chāndogya, the Bṛhadāraṇyaka, and the Muṇḍaka — as the premier illustration of Brahman's non-contamination despite pervasiveness, and here Bhagavān employs it with precision. The logical structure is impeccable: ākāśa is sarva-gata (all-pervading) yet upalipyate na (not tainted), because it is sūkṣma (subtle) relative to the gross objects within it. Similarly, the Ātman is sarvatra avasthitaḥ (present everywhere in the body), yet precisely because it transcends even the subtlest modification of mind and matter, it remains na upalipyate. The Vedāntic term for this is 'asaṅga' — the Unattached — and Śaṅkarācārya in his commentary notes that the analogy works because both ākāśa and Ātman share the quality of being niravayava (without parts), which is the root of their imperturbability. The seeker who truly grasps this verse is on the threshold of direct experience of the Self.","yogananda":"The ether analogy used here is not merely poetic — it is a precise metaphysical map. In the yogic cosmology, ākāśa is the primordial vibratory ground of all creation, the 'Aum-substance' from which gross matter condenses; yet even this subtlest element is still within Prakṛti, still part of the created order. The Ātman is beyond even ākāśa, subtler than vibration itself, quieter than the silence between sounds. When in deep meditation the practitioner withdraws awareness from the senses, the mind, and even the feeling of energy in the body, what remains — that pure, featureless, unbounded awareness — is the Self described in this verse: sarvatra avasthitaḥ (present everywhere) yet na upalipyate (touched by nothing). This is the experience of kaivalya — the soul resting in its own infinite nature, uncontracted by any object, relation, or circumstance.","goyandka":"Having established in the previous verse the philosophical grounds for Ātman's non-contamination (anāditva and nirguṇatva), Bhagavān here provides an experiential analogy accessible to all. The ākāśa illustration works on two levels: first, it demonstrates pervasive non-attachment — sarva-gata yet untainted; second, it reveals why this is so — saukṣmyāt, due to subtlety. One should note the progression: among the pañca-mahābhūtas, ākāśa is the subtlest and hence least susceptible to modification; the Ātman is subtler than all elements combined and is therefore absolutely untouched. The phrase 'dehe avasthitaḥ' should be understood carefully — the Self does not become the body by residing in it, just as space does not become a pot by being enclosed within it (the famous ghaṭākāśa and mahākāśa distinction of Vedānta). The 'pot-space' appears limited but is in truth the infinite Space itself; the 'body-self' appears individual but is the universal Ātman."}},{"verse":33,"sanskrit":"यथा प्रकाशयत्य् एकः कृत्स्नं लोकम् इमं रविः ।\\nक्षेत्रं क्षेत्री तथा कृत्स्नं प्रकाशयति भारत ॥","transliteration":"yathā prakāśayati ekaḥ kṛtsnam lokam imam raviḥ |\\nkṣetram kṣetrī tathā kṛtsnam prakāśayati bhārata ||","translation":"As the one sun illumines this entire world, so the Kṣetrin (the Lord of the field, Kṣetrajña) illumines the entire kṣetra (all fields), O Bhārata.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_33.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"यथा","meaning":"just as; introduces the sun analogy (ravi-dṛṣṭānta), one of the Gītā's most celebrated illustrations"},{"word":"प्रकाशयति","meaning":"illumines, makes manifest, causes to shine; from pra + kāś = to shine; the Ātman illumines not by physical light but by Consciousness"},{"word":"एकः","meaning":"one, single, alone; the crucial word — one sun, one Self; non-duality in the most direct statement"},{"word":"कृत्स्नम्","meaning":"entire, whole, complete, without remainder; not partially but fully — the entire world, the entire kṣetra"},{"word":"लोकम्","meaning":"world, realm; the entire perceptible and imperceptible universe; all that is within the field of experience"},{"word":"इमम्","meaning":"this; the demonstrative pointing to the world immediately present — not abstract but this very world before us"},{"word":"रविः","meaning":"the sun; from ravi = the shining one; the sun as cosmic illuminator, giver of all visibility and life"},{"word":"क्षेत्रम्","meaning":"the field; the body-mind-sense complex and by extension all embodied beings, the entire realm of Prakṛti"},{"word":"क्षेत्री","meaning":"the owner/lord of the field; the knower, the Kṣetrajña, the Ātman as the illumining witness-Consciousness"},{"word":"तथा","meaning":"so, in like manner; the analogy resolves — what the sun is to the physical world, the Kṣetrajña is to all fields"},{"word":"भारत","meaning":"O descendant of Bharata; Arjuna addressed by his dynastic name, placing this ultimate teaching in the context of his noble lineage"},{"word":"रवि-दृष्टान्त","meaning":"the sun analogy; not mentioned explicitly but the technical name for this illustration used in Vedāntic commentaries"},{"word":"क्षेत्री-प्रकाश","meaning":"the illumination by the Kṣetrajña; Consciousness that makes all contents of the field (perceptions, thoughts, emotions) knowable"},{"word":"एक-क्षेत्रज्ञ","meaning":"the one Knower of all fields; the single non-dual Consciousness appearing as if multiple due to multiple bodies, just as one sun appears multiplied in many pools of water"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"Of all the analogies in this luminous chapter, this one shines the brightest — the sun. One sun, and yet it fills this entire universe with light; there is not a shadow, not a grain of dust, not a tear on a cheek that is not illumined by this single radiance. And just so, there is one Kṣetrajña — one pure Consciousness — and all the countless bodies in all the countless worlds are illumined, known, and made real by this one Light. Bhagavān addresses Arjuna as 'Bhārata' here — child of the great lineage — as if to say: you come from greatness, now recognize the greatest truth of all. There are not many selves, dear one; there is one Self wearing many faces, one Sun shining through many windows. When you recognize the Sun rather than the windows, you have seen God.","sarvapriyananda":"The ravi-dṛṣṭānta (sun analogy) here is the culmination of the chapter's teaching on the relationship between Kṣetra and Kṣetrajña, and it makes the Advaita (non-dual) position unmistakable. The Kṣetrajña is ekaḥ — one — and this 'one' is not numerical oneness (which would still imply a possible many) but the non-dual One without a second. Just as the sun's light falls on all objects without the sun multiplying or dividing itself, the single Kṣetrajña illumines all fields (kṛtsnaṃ kṣetram) without fragmenting into separate selves. The apparent multiplicity of individual kṣetrajñas — one per body — is like the multiplicity of sun-reflections in a thousand pots of water: the reflected images are many, the sun is one. Śaṅkara uses precisely this pratibimba-vāda (reflection theory) to explain how Brahman appears as jīvas. The word 'kṛtsnam' (entire, without remainder) leaves no room for a portion of the field unillumined — there is no corner of experience, however dark or confused, that lies outside the scope of Consciousness.","yogananda":"The sun analogy is one of the most exquisite in all sacred literature, for the sun is the most accessible symbol of what Cosmic Consciousness actually is. Consider: the sun does not choose which flower to illuminate and which to leave in darkness; it shines on the saint and the sinner, on the diamond and the mud, with equal impartiality. This is exactly the nature of the Kṣetrajña — universal, non-discriminating, effortlessly illuminating. In deep samādhi, the yogi does not merge with a personal God but with this Cosmic Sun of Consciousness, and in that mergence realizes: 'I was always this.' The kṛtsnaṃ kṣetram — the entire field — means that no thought, no memory, no sensation could ever be known without this Light of Awareness; when you ask 'what is it that knows this experience?', you are touching the Sun. And there is only one asker, one knower, one Sun — the word 'ekaḥ' is perhaps the most liberating word in the entire Gītā.","goyandka":"This verse accomplishes in one śloka what entire treatises attempt to establish: the unity of the Kṣetrajña across all kṣetras. The logical force of the analogy proceeds thus — we observe that the sun, though one (ekaḥ), illumines the entire world (kṛtsnaṃ lokam); we do not posit a separate sun for each country, city, or house. By analogical reasoning (anumāna), we should conclude that the Kṣetrajña, being one Consciousness, illumines all kṣetras without needing to be multiplied. The word 'prakāśayati' is crucial: just as the sun enables all objects to be seen without itself being an object, the Kṣetrajña enables all contents of experience to be known while itself remaining the non-objectifiable Subject. It cannot be made an object of knowledge because it is the very light by which all knowledge occurs — this is the Vedāntic concept of the 'self-luminous' (svayam-prakāśa) nature of Ātman. The conclusion for sādhana is direct: do not seek the Self as an object; recognize that you are the seeking Awareness itself."}},{"verse":34,"sanskrit":"क्षेत्र-क्षेत्रज्ञयोर् एवम् अन्तरम् ज्ञान-चक्षुषा ।\\nभूत-प्रकृति-मोक्षं च ये विदुर् यान्ति ते परम् ॥","transliteration":"kṣetra-kṣetrajñayoḥ evam antaram jñāna-cakṣuṣā |\\nbhūta-prakṛti-mokṣam ca ye viduḥ yānti te param ||","translation":"Those who thus perceive with the eye of wisdom (jñāna-cakṣus) the distinction between the kṣetra and kṣetrajña, and liberation from the Prakṛti-nature of beings — they go to the Supreme.","audio":"/assets/audio/ch13/verse_13_34.mp3","word_breakdown":[{"word":"क्षेत्र-क्षेत्रज्ञयोः","meaning":"of the field and the knower of the field; genitive dual — the entire chapter's two-term framework summarized in a single compound"},{"word":"एवम्","meaning":"thus, in this way; referring to all that has been taught in this chapter — the thorough understanding arrived at through all 33 preceding verses"},{"word":"अन्तरम्","meaning":"the distinction, difference, interval between; the viveka — discriminative knowledge — that sees them as fundamentally different in nature"},{"word":"ज्ञान-चक्षुषा","meaning":"with the eye of wisdom/knowledge; jñāna = knowledge, cakṣus = eye; the inner eye of discriminative understanding that transcends ordinary perception"},{"word":"भूत-प्रकृति-मोक्षम्","meaning":"liberation from the Prakṛti of beings; bhūta = beings/creatures, prakṛti = primal nature, mokṣa = release/freedom; freedom from the cycle of embodiment driven by Prakṛti"},{"word":"च","meaning":"and; connecting two objects of jñāna: (1) the kṣetra-kṣetrajña distinction and (2) liberation from bhūta-prakṛti"},{"word":"ये विदुः","meaning":"those who know/perceive; viduḥ from vid = to know/see; not merely intellectual knowing but direct realization (vijñāna)"},{"word":"यान्ति","meaning":"they go, they reach, they attain; the movement toward liberation — not through physical travel but through shift of identity and understanding"},{"word":"ते","meaning":"they; those specific ones who have achieved this direct perception — an encouragement that such liberation is attainable"},{"word":"परम्","meaning":"the Supreme, the Highest; paraṃ Brahma — not a place to go but a recognition of one's own ultimate nature; the Supreme that is one's own deepest Self"},{"word":"ज्ञान-चक्षुस्","meaning":"the eye of wisdom; in Vedānta, this refers to the purified intellect (śuddha-buddhi) capable of discriminating Ātman from anātman, Puruṣa from Prakṛti"},{"word":"मोक्ष","meaning":"liberation, release, freedom; the fourth puruṣārtha and the supreme aim of the Gītā's teaching; here specifically, release from bhūta-prakṛti"},{"word":"विवेक","meaning":"discriminative wisdom; though not appearing explicitly, antaram jñāna-cakṣuṣā is the definition of viveka — the core qualification for liberation in Advaita Vedānta"},{"word":"परम् यान्ति","meaning":"they attain the Supreme; the chapter's final promise and the entire Gītā's purpose in two words — those who perceive rightly go to the Highest"}],"commentary":{"dadaji":"And with this final verse, Bhagavān extends his most loving invitation — not a command, not a doctrine, but an open hand reaching toward every soul. 'Those who thus perceive with the eye of wisdom' — the 'thus' is the accumulated light of all thirty-four verses, the whole chapter's journey arriving at this single point. The jñāna-cakṣus, the eye of wisdom, is not something to be acquired from outside; it is the natural vision of the heart purified by love, selfless action, and sincere inquiry. When this eye opens — truly opens — one sees with luminous clarity that the body-mind is the field, the pure Witness is the Knower, and one's own Self has never been touched by anything the field has passed through. Bhūta-prakṛti-mokṣam — freedom from being swept along by nature's currents — is the fruit. And 'param' — the Supreme — is where they go. Where is the Supreme? It is here. It has always been here. It is what you are. Come home, beloved.","sarvapriyananda":"This concluding verse is architecturally perfect as the resolution of the entire chapter's argument. The chapter opened by establishing the kṣetra-kṣetrajña distinction (v.1-3), elaborated the nature of the kṣetra (v.5-7), described the qualities of jñāna (v.8-12), explained the nature of the kṣetrajña as Brahman (v.13-18), explored the interplay of Puruṣa and Prakṛti (v.19-23), and described the various paths to liberation (v.24-29). Now the conclusion: the fruit of all this understanding is jñāna-cakṣus — the eye of wisdom — that perceives the antaram (distinction) between kṣetra and kṣetrajña. 'Bhūta-prakṛti-mokṣam' points to what this discrimination achieves: freedom from the mistaken identification with Prakṛti that is the root of all saṃsāra. The result — 'te param yānti' — is stated simply and absolutely: they go to the Supreme. In Advaita terms, this 'going' is an apparent movement; in reality it is a removal of the veil (āvaraṇa) that concealed what was always and already present. The chapter ends not with a ritual, a practice, or a prayer, but with knowledge — jñāna — as the supreme liberator.","yogananda":"The 'eye of wisdom' — jñāna-cakṣus — is what the yogic traditions call the spiritual eye or the third eye, the center of divine perception located at the point between the eyebrows. But it is not merely anatomical; it is the faculty of consciousness that can directly perceive truth rather than merely reason about it. When this eye opens fully, the practitioner does not merely believe in the distinction between the Self and Prakṛti — they see it directly, as clearly as they see a flower. And this seeing is itself the liberation: bhūta-prakṛti-mokṣam — freedom from being bound by the nature of embodied existence — is not a future event but the immediate fruit of this clarity. 'Te param yānti' — they attain the Supreme — and the Supreme toward which they travel is the infinite ocean of Consciousness into which the individual wave dissolves and realizes it was always the ocean. The entire Bhagavad Gītā is teaching this one thing: know who you are, and be free.","goyandka":"The concluding verse of the thirteenth chapter brings the entire discourse of kṣetra and kṣetrajña to its practical resolution. Three things are specified as the objects of this liberating perception: (1) the kṣetra itself, thoroughly described in verses 5-7; (2) the kṣetrajña, thoroughly described in verses 13-18 and 26-34; and (3) bhūta-prakṛti-mokṣam — freedom from the Prakṛti that constitutes the individual being's bondage. The instrument is jñāna-cakṣus — the eye of direct knowledge — not inference, not faith, not ritual observance alone, but clear discriminative vision. Śrī Śaṅkarācārya notes in his Gītā-bhāṣya that 'antaram' (distinction) here refers specifically to the absolute difference in nature: kṣetra is jaḍa (insentient), kṣetrajña is cit (pure sentience); kṣetra changes, kṣetrajña is immutable; kṣetra is bound, kṣetrajña is eternally free. The one who perceives this with the firmness and clarity of direct realization — 'ye viduḥ' — attains 'param', the Supreme Reality that the entire śāstra declares to be identical with one's own innermost Self. This is the upaśama, the supreme peace and conclusion of the thirteenth chapter."}}]`),t={chapter:13,verses:e};export{a as chapter,t as default,e as verses};
