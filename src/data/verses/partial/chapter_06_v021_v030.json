        "dadaji": "Dadaji would read this verse slowly, letting the word 'ātyantikaṃ' — infinite, absolute, without end — sink in. He used to say that all the bliss we seek through our eyes, our ears, our affections is real bliss — but it is a tiny, limited, temporary fragment of this infinite sukham. The difference is that worldly bliss is indriya-grāhyam — grasped by the senses — and therefore subject to the limitations of the senses: it comes and goes, it depends on outer conditions. But this bliss — this ātyantika sukham — is buddhi-grāhyam: it is perceived by the innermost knowing faculty, the purified intellect, which has turned back toward its source. And once found, one never wanders from it. 'Sthitaś calati tattvataḥ' — the one established in it never departs from truth. That is the miracle: it is permanent.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "This verse begins the celebrated four-verse description of the samādhi-state (verses 21-23) and contains perhaps the most precise philosophical description of spiritual bliss in the entire Gita. Swami Sarvapriyananda highlights two key qualifiers for this sukham: it is ātyantikaṃ (infinite, absolute — not subject to degrees or conditions) and it is buddhi-grāhyam atīndriyam (grasped by the buddhi, yet beyond the senses). This is a crucial Vedantic distinction: ānanda (bliss) is not a sensory experience and cannot be reached by any refinement of sensory perception. Yet it is not completely inaccessible — the purified buddhi, in its state of perfect transparency, directly cognizes it. This is the pratyakṣa (direct perception) of the Ātman — not inference, not scripture-study, but direct knowing.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda lavishes his commentary on the phrase 'buddhi-grāhyam atīndriyam' — beyond the senses, yet apprehended by the intellect. He explains that in deep meditation, when the five senses are completely withdrawn and even the lower mind is stilled, the buddhi — the highest faculty of the causal body — remains luminous and active. It is in this refined instrument that the bliss of the Self is first cognized. The meditator does not feel this bliss through the body or the emotions; it arises as a profound interior knowing, a direct perception of one's own nature as ānanda. And once experienced, 'sthitaś calati tattvataḥ' — the yogi established in this knows with certainty: all outer pleasures are pale shadows of this reality.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary carefully unpacks the paradox of 'buddhi-grāhyam atīndriyam' — grasped by the intellect yet beyond the senses. How can something beyond the senses be grasped at all? The resolution is that the buddhi, when purified by yoga, acquires a mode of knowing that does not depend on sense-data — the direct, immediate self-luminous knowledge called aparokṣānubhūti in the Vedantic tradition. 'Tattvataḥ' — from truth — in the final pāda means that having once stood in the ground of reality, one does not fall away from it. This is the Gita's description of jīvanmukti: the permanent establishment in truth that does not depend on continued meditative effort to sustain itself."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji used to say that this verse is how you recognize a true saint — not by their miraculous powers or their external austerities, but by these two signs: they do not want anything more than what they have, and heavy grief cannot shake them. 'Yaṃ labdhvā cāparaṃ lābhaṃ manyate nādhikam' — having found this, nothing else seems greater. That is the test. Most of us always want the next thing, a slightly better version of what we have. The saint's wanting is stilled — not because they are suppressed, but because they are full. And the second quality — 'guruṇāpi duḥkhena na vicālyate' — is the test of grief. Life will bring grief; it cannot be avoided. But the one established in this state is not uprooted by it. They feel it, but they are not defined by it.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda presents this verse as providing two operational tests for genuine spiritual attainment: the test of gain and the test of loss. First, 'yaṃ labdhvā aparaṃ lābhaṃ nādhikaṃ manyate' — having gained this, one considers no other gain greater. This is the test of complete desirelessness: the state in which the Self, recognized as pūrṇa (complete), generates no more reaching toward external objects. Second, 'yasmin sthito na guruṇāpi duḥkhena vicālyate' — established in which, not shaken even by the heaviest sorrow. This is the test of equanimity under extreme adverse conditions. Together they describe the sthitaprajña — the one of steady wisdom — whose interior life has become immune to both the seductions of gain and the devastations of loss.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda finds in this verse the Gita's portrait of what he calls the 'superconscious man' — one who has awakened to their true nature. The first half — no gain is considered greater — reflects the truth that God's bliss, once directly tasted even briefly, reveals all sensory pleasure as thin and transient by comparison. Yogananda writes that even a single deep experience of samādhi leaves such an impression of fullness that the seeker loses much of their previous hunger for worldly satisfactions. The second quality — unshakeability under heavy grief — is the fruit of understanding that the Self is eternal, unborn, and undying. When the identity is rooted in the Ātman, the death of a loved one, failure, or catastrophe is seen with deep compassion but without existential devastation.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary reads this verse as the definitive description of the state of nitya-tṛpti — permanent contentment. 'Lābhaṃ nādhikaṃ manyate' — considers no gain greater — is the sign of absolute pūrṇatā (completeness): when the infinite Self is realized as one's own nature, what can any finite acquisition add? Goyandka emphasizes the word 'guruṇāpi' — even by the heaviest. Lesser griefs test the yogi; the heaviest griefs test them absolutely. The truly established one is 'yasmin sthitaḥ' — seated in that state — and therefore 'na vicālyate' — not displaced. The compound duḥkhena guruṇāpi covers all forms of extreme suffering: bereavement, physical pain, failure, dishonour — none of these can shake the one whose foundation is the Ātman."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji considered this one of the most important practical verses in the entire Gita. Krishna here gives us his own definition of yoga — not as a technique, not as a posture, not as a philosophy — but as 'duḥkha-saṃyoga-viyogam': the severance of the union with pain. Notice it is not the severance of pain itself — pain may still arise — but the severance of our compulsive, habitual union with it. We are bound to pain because we identify with the body-mind and its experiences. Yoga is the gradual, then complete, loosening of that identification. And how is it to be practised? 'Niścayena anirviṇṇa-cetasā' — with firm resolve and an unwearied heart. No giving up, no self-pity, no saying 'it is too hard.' That is the whole instruction.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that this verse contains the Gita's own authoritative definition of yoga — and it is negative in form: yoga is that which severs the union with pain. This negative definition is deliberate and profound. The positive content of yoga (bliss, realization, union with Brahman) is indescribable in ordinary language; but its effect — the permanent ending of suffering — can be precisely stated. 'Duḥkha-saṃyoga' literally means the conjunction or contact with pain — the sorrow that comes from identifying the self with the body-mind complex and its inevitable vicissitudes. 'Viyoga' is the complete separation from this. The instruction 'niścayena yoktavyaḥ' — to be practised with certainty — means that doubt is the greatest obstacle to yoga. One must be determined.",
        "yogananda": "For Yogananda, 'duḥkha-saṃyoga-viyogam' is the most compassionate definition of yoga he encountered anywhere in scripture. The entire purpose of the path is freedom from suffering — not the stoic endurance of suffering, not its philosophical explanation, but its root severance. He explains that suffering arises from the misidentification of the self with the ego and body — what he called the 'cosmic dream.' Yoga wakes us from that dream. The instruction 'anirviṇṇa-cetasā' — with an unwearied heart — he considered especially important for Western students, who often approach meditation with great initial enthusiasm but abandon the practice when quick results do not come. The yogi must be like a surgeon — committed, precise, patient, never giving up before the operation is complete.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary treats this verse as the summative definition of the entire Chapter 6 teaching. Three things are stated: the nature of yoga (duḥkha-saṃyoga-viyogam — disjunction from suffering), the necessity of resolve (niścayena — with determination), and the quality of mind required (anirviṇṇa-cetasā — without discouragement). Goyandka notes that 'yoktavyaḥ' — is to be practised, ought to be practised — carries the force of a moral imperative: this is not optional for the seeker of liberation. The compound 'anirviṇṇa-cetasā' is particularly analyzed: nirviṇṇa (from vi + √vid) means one who has turned away in disgust or lost heart; 'anirviṇṇa' is one who has not — the steadfast practitioner who perseveres regardless of how slow the progress seems."

        "dadaji": "Dadaji always marvelled at the precision of 'saṅkalpa-prabhavān kāmān' — desires born of saṅkalpa, of volitional thought. This is such an important insight. Desires do not fall from the sky; they are manufactured by the mind through the activity of saṅkalpa — the moment we start imagining, projecting, fantasizing about something. Before the saṅkalpa there is no desire; desire is born in the mind's creative activity. Therefore, when Krishna says abandon all desires, he means first: still the saṅkalpa-making. When the mind stops constructing scenarios of future fulfilment, desires lose their fuel. The instruction 'manasaiva' — by the mind alone — is remarkable: the restraint of the senses is not done by force or external constraint but by the mind's own turning inward. True freedom is always from within.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda finds in 'saṅkalpa-prabhavān kāmān' a precise statement of the Vedantic psychology of desire. Kāma (desire) is not a raw datum of experience; it is manufactured. The process is: first comes saṅkalpa (the imagination of an object as desirable), then comes kāma (the wanting of it), then comes karma (the action to obtain it). Cut the saṅkalpa and the entire chain collapses. This is why the Gita so consistently emphasizes the stilling of saṅkalpa rather than the mere suppression of action. 'Manasaiva indriya-grāmaṃ viniyamya' — restraining the senses by the mind alone — means that genuine sense-control is not physical suppression but mental reorientation: when the mind withdraws its interest from sensory objects, the senses naturally follow.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda reads this verse as the description of pratyāhāra — the fifth limb of Patañjali's ashtanga yoga — carried to its completion. 'Saṅkalpa-prabhavān kāmān tyaktvā aśeṣataḥ' — abandoning without remainder all desires born of selfish will — is a radical instruction. Not some desires, not gross desires while keeping refined ones, but all of them, without remainder (aśeṣataḥ). He explains that this does not mean the yogi becomes inert or indifferent to the world, but that their actions arise from divine inspiration rather than personal craving. 'Manasaiva' — by the mind alone — is the key: as the meditator deepens their practice, the mind turns inward and naturally loses its outward-pulling force, and the senses, deprived of the mind's projecting energy, fall silent.",
        "goyandka": "This verse, continues Goyandka's commentary, is the practical instruction that follows the definition of yoga in verse 23. Having defined yoga as the severance of union with pain, Krishna now describes the mechanics: first, abandon desire completely (vv. 24); next, progressively deepen through the stages of vv. 25-26. The phrase 'aśeṣataḥ' — without residue — is critical. The tradition recognizes that partial abandonment of desire leaves seeds (saṃskāras) that will eventually sprout again. Complete abandonment, described here, is the uprooting of the very capacity for self-willed desire. 'Samantataḥ' — from every side — suggests that the restraint must be total: not controlling some senses while leaving others free to roam, but bringing the entire indriya-grāma (the collective of all senses) under unified mental direction."

Dadaji said Krishna uses them deliberately to protect sincere seekers from the terrible impatience that destroys spiritual practice. We want immediate results; we try to force the mind into stillness, and the forcing itself creates agitation. But Krishna says: gradually, gradually. This is not laziness — it is wisdom. The buddhi held firm by dhṛti (fortitude) guides the process: not by gripping the mind tightly, but by providing a steady, unwavering direction. And the goal: 'ātma-saṃsthaṃ manaḥ kṛtvā' — the mind made to rest in the Self — is then to think of absolutely nothing. Not to think of God, not to contemplate a form. Nothing. Pure, luminous silence.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda identifies this verse as the Gita's most explicit description of the technique of dhyāna (meditation) in the specific sense of the gradual withdrawal of the mind from all objects. 'Śanaiḥ śanaiḥ' — the repetition itself enacts the gradualness it describes. 'Uparamed' — from upa+√ram, to cease movement — refers to the progressive quieting of the citta-vṛttis (mental fluctuations). The instrument is 'buddhyā dhṛti-gṛhītayā' — the buddhi endowed with dhṛti (steady courage and patience). The buddhi's role here is to keep returning the mind to its object without strain or self-reproach. The final phrase 'na kiñcid api cintayet' — should think of nothing whatsoever — describes the state beyond concentration, the threshold of samādhi.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda considered 'śanaiḥ śanaiḥ' the great mercy-instruction of the Gita. In his autobiography and commentaries he describes how he himself — even with his great spiritual gifts — did not attain samādhi in a single sitting but through years of sustained, patient practice. He interprets 'dhṛti-gṛhītayā' — held by fortitude — as the quality he calls 'spiritual tenacity': not forcing the mind, but gently, persistently returning it to the inner focus every time it wanders. 'Ātma-saṃsthaṃ manaḥ kṛtvā' — mind established in the Self — is the pivot point: once the mind is anchored in the Self, the final instruction becomes natural: 'na kiñcid api cintayet' — think of nothing. In that no-thought awareness, the divine is revealed.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka's classical commentary treats this verse as prescribing a sequential, graded practice. Step one: withdraw the senses (v.24). Step two: progressively still the mind (v.25). The word 'uparamed' (optative form) suggests this is a practice to be actively engaged — not a passive waiting. 'Buddhyā dhṛti-gṛhītayā' describes the specific role of the buddhi: it must be armed with dhṛti (patient fortitude) because the path to stillness is long and the mind will resist many times. The buddhi is the inner teacher that keeps redirecting the mind toward the Self. Once the mind is established in the Self ('ātma-saṃstham'), the final instruction 'na kiñcid api cintayet' — not even the smallest thing should be thought — marks the transition from dhāraṇā (concentration) to dhyāna (meditation) to samādhi (absorption)."

The mind is 'cañcalam asthiram' — restless and unsteady — and there is no shame in this; it is the nature of the unawakened mind. What matters is not that it does not wander, but what you do each time it does: 'tatas tato niyamya' — from there, from there, restrain it. Again and again. Each return is not a failure; each return is the practice itself. And always toward the same destination: 'ātmany eva' — the Self alone.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda calls this verse 'the meditator's most reliable friend.' The correlative constructions 'yato yataḥ... tatas tataḥ' — wherever... from there — cover every possible direction of mental wandering without exception. There is no place the mind can go from which it cannot be returned. This is deeply reassuring: the practice is never ruined by distraction, only interrupted. The key word is 'nayet' — the optative of √nī, to lead — rather than a harsh word for forcing. The mind is not to be beaten back but gently led, as one would lead a child or a gentle animal that has strayed. 'Ātmany eva vaśam' — into the power of the Self alone — is the destination: not concentration on a deity form or a mantra (which are means), but the Self itself.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda treasured this verse above almost any other in Chapter 6. He taught it to every student of meditation as the fundamental instruction that makes persistent, long-term practice possible. He said: if you know only this one verse, you know the entire technique of meditation. The mind will go out — it will go to a memory, a plan, an anxiety, a sensation. The moment you notice it has gone, bring it back. Not with anger at yourself, not with discouragement, but with the patient, cheerful determination of a devoted gardener returning a climbing vine to its trellis. 'Ātmany eva' — to the Self alone — is the trellis. Every return is a small victory. Over time, the intervals of wandering grow shorter and the intervals of resting in the Self grow longer.",
        "goyandka": "Goyandka notes that this verse is the practical complement to verse 25: verse 25 describes the goal and the method in general; verse 26 addresses what to do when — inevitably — the method encounters the mind's natural resistance. The 'yato yataḥ... tatas tataḥ' construction (wherever... from there) is exhaustive: it leaves no exception. Whatever the content of the distraction — noble or base, spiritual or mundane — the instruction is the same: bring it back. 'Niyamya' (having restrained) implies a gentle but firm act of will, not violent suppression. 'Vaśam nayet' — bring under sway — implies a transfer of sovereignty: the wandering mind is under the sway of objects; the yogi's task is to bring it under the sway of the Self. This is the entire practice of dhyāna in a single verse."

        "dadaji": "Here Krishna describes the yogi who has arrived — and notice the beauty of how he describes this person. Not 'the one who has accumulated merit' or 'the one who has performed great austerities.' Four qualities: praśānta-manas (the mind deeply stilled), śānta-rajas (the fire of passion cooled), brahma-bhūta (become Brahman — not approaching Brahman, not worshipping Brahman, but become Brahman), and akalmaṣa (without a single blemish). Dadaji would say this last quality — free from blemish — is not about moral perfection in the conventional sense, but about the complete washing away of saṃskāras, the stains left by past actions and desires. And to such a one comes sukham uttamam — the supreme bliss — and notice: it comes (upaiti), it approaches the yogi, as if bliss itself recognizes where its home is.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda notes that 'brahma-bhūtam' — having become Brahman — is one of the most significant phrases in the Gita, and it recurs in Chapter 18 (verse 54) as the foundation of the highest devotion. To 'become Brahman' does not mean creation of a new identity but the removal of the false one: the ego-self that has superimposed itself on the ātman. When the superimposition is removed through the practices described in the preceding verses, what remains is Brahman — not as something newly acquired but as what always was. The four adjectives applied to this yogi — praśānta-manasam, śānta-rajasam, brahma-bhūtam, akalmaṣam — trace a clear sequence: stilling of mind leads to stilling of passion, which leads to recognition of Brahman-nature, which reveals the natural stainlessness of the Self.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda finds in 'brahma-bhūtam' the key to the entire verse. He explains that there is a crucial difference between the spiritual aspirant who meditates on Brahman as an object of contemplation and the realized yogi who has become Brahman. The former is still the experiencer facing an experience; the latter is the merging of experiencer, experiencing, and experience into a single luminous reality. The order of the four attributes is significant: first the mind must be stilled (praśānta-manas), then the rajasic agitation must subside (śānta-rajas), then the Brahman-nature is recognized (brahma-bhūta), and this recognition reveals the natural purity that was always there but hidden (akalmaṣa). To such a one, sukham uttamam — supreme bliss — does not arrive from outside but wells up from within as the Self's own nature.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary treats this verse as the fruit-verse (phala-śruti) for the entire meditation practice described since verse 11. The four compounds — praśānta-manas, śānta-rajas, brahma-bhūta, akalmaṣa — describe the state of the perfected yogi from four angles: psychological (stilled mind), physiological-energetic (quieted rajas), ontological (become Brahman), and moral-spiritual (without blemish). 'Upaiti' — comes to, approaches — suggests that sukham uttamam is not something the yogi creates or achieves through effort; it is something that naturally arrives when the obstacles are removed, like sunlight that floods a room the moment the shutters are opened. The supreme bliss is ever-present; the disciplines merely remove what has been blocking it."

Not seen from a distance, not intellectually grasped, not worshipped from afar — touched. Saṃsparśa is an intimate word: it means skin-contact, the feeling of being touched. The mystics of every tradition have described this moment — the moment when the boundary between the individual and the Divine dissolves into a felt union. And notice 'sukhena' — with ease. Not with strain, not after heroic final effort, but with ease. This is because the yogi who has faithfully followed all the preceding instructions has already done the hard work of removal. The touch of Brahman is not something earned — it is something revealed when the obstacles are gone.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda draws attention to the extraordinary word 'brahma-saṃsparśam' — the contact with Brahman, the touch of the Absolute. In Vedantic epistemology, the highest knowledge is aparokṣānubhūti — not mediated, direct, immediate knowing. Saṃsparśa (touch) is the most immediate of all sensory metaphors — closer than seeing, more intimate than hearing. It suggests that the realization of Brahman is not an intellectual conclusion but an immediate, unmediated experience of identity — a knowing that is simultaneously a being. 'Sukhena' — with ease — is the sign that this state is arrived at effortlessly because it is the Self's own nature. It is only the obstacles that take effort to remove; the underlying reality is always here, always easy, always natural.",
        "yogananda": "Yogananda considers 'brahma-saṃsparśam' one of the most evocative descriptions of samādhi in the Gita. The word saṃsparśa — touch — is deliberately sensory: it points to an experience that is felt, not merely understood. He recounts from his own experience that the first touch of Brahman in deep meditation feels like being bathed in an ocean of living light — an experience so vast and so intimate simultaneously that the ordinary sense of 'I' and 'other' simply dissolves. 'Sukhena' — with ease — is the sign of genuine divine grace: at the moment of final surrender, all effort ceases, and the soul is simply taken. 'Atyantaṃ sukham aśnute' — enjoys infinite bliss — is not a poetic exaggeration but a statement of direct experience that every true mystic confirms.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary carefully distinguishes between two aspects of 'atyantaṃ sukham': the bliss that is atyanta (infinite, absolute) and the mode of its attainment — sukhena (with ease). This is a profound teaching: the bliss of Brahman is not hard to attain in itself, but it becomes easy to attain only for the one who has removed the obstacles through sustained practice (yuñjan evam sadā) and inner purification (vigata-kalmaṣaḥ). The compound 'vigata-kalmaṣaḥ' — from whom impurity has departed — indicates that the purification is complete, not partial. This corresponds to the Vedantic concept of citta-śuddhi as the prerequisite for brahmajñāna. Goyandka notes that 'aśnute' (from √aś, to pervade and enjoy) implies that the yogi does not merely perceive Brahman but pervades it and is pervaded by it — a state of complete mutual indwelling."

Dadaji called this verse the vision of the saint in daily life: when the yogi comes out of deep meditation, the world looks different. Not different in its surface appearances — the cow is still a cow, the stone a stone — but the light within everything is seen. 'Sarva-bhūtastham ātmānam' — the Self dwelling in all beings — and 'sarva-bhūtāni cātmani' — all beings in the Self. This is not a philosophical belief; it is direct perception, described by 'īkṣate.' And the practical consequence: 'sarvatra sama-darśanaḥ' — seeing everywhere with equal eyes. Not equal in the sense of ignoring differences, but equal in recognizing the same divine presence in the saint and the sinner, the beautiful and the ugly, the friend and the enemy.",
        "sarvapriyananda": "Swami Sarvapriyananda identifies this verse as the Gita's most explicit statement of the non-dual vision — what the Upaniṣads call sarvam khalv idaṃ brahma (all this is indeed Brahman). The two complementary perceptions — 'sarva-bhūtastham ātmānam' (the Self in all beings) and 'sarva-bhūtāni cātmani' (all beings in the Self) — represent the two directions of the non-dual vision: looking outward, the yogi sees the one Self everywhere; looking inward, the yogi sees the entire universe within the Self. This is the Vedantic seer's vision described in the Īśā Upaniṣad: 'He who sees all beings in the Self and the Self in all beings loses all hatred.' The practical-ethical consequence is 'sama-darśana' — equal vision — the fruit of wisdom.",

'Yoga-yuktātmā' — the self perfected through yoga — is the key qualifier: this is not a temporary mystical experience but the permanent state of the fully realized yogi. 'Sarvatra sama-darśanaḥ' — equal vision everywhere — does not mean the yogi becomes indifferent to distinctions, but that beneath all differences the yogi perceives the one Presence, the one Self, playing all the roles of the cosmic drama. He relates this to his own experience of cosmic consciousness described in his autobiography — the experience in which the walls of the room expanded to contain the universe and the universe was felt as one's own Self.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary treats this verse as the description of jīvanmukti — liberation while still embodied — in its experiential dimension. The phrase 'yoga-yuktātmā' — one whose ātman is properly united through yoga — indicates that this is the fruit specifically of the dhyāna yoga taught in this chapter, not a gift that arrives independently of practice. The verse describes a double vision: upward (the Self in all beings) and downward (all beings in the Self) — like seeing both the gold in every ornament and every ornament as gold. 'Sama-darśanaḥ' (equal vision) does not deny the empirical differences between beings — a blade of grass and a human being are empirically different — but it affirms that at the level of ultimate reality, both are expressions of the one Self, and the realized yogi sees this directly."

If you can see Krishna — the Divine — in everything and everything in the Divine, then you are held. You are seen. You are never lost, even for a moment. And God is never hidden from you. The mystical relationship is permanent, mutual, and unconditional.",

Verse 29 is in the third person — the yogi sees the Self in all. Verse 30 is in the first person — Krishna speaks directly, personally: I am never lost to him, and he is never lost to Me. This shift from philosophical description to personal address is significant: the non-dual vision is not a cold abstraction but a living relationship. 'Na praṇaśyāmi' — I do not become lost — is a divine guarantee. 'Praṇaśyati' (from pra + √naś) means to vanish, to be destroyed, to become invisible. The one who has attained sama-darśana can never lose sight of the Divine, because they have recognized the Divine as the very substance of their own seeing.",
        "yogananda": "For Yogananda, this verse is the supreme devotional promise in the Gita — the moment where philosophical teaching gives way to the voice of divine love. He writes that these words of Krishna are addressed to every sincere meditator, in every age. The one who trains their inner eye to see the Divine everywhere — in the flower, the storm, the stranger, the moment of suffering and the moment of joy — that one will never lose God. And equally, Krishna says, God will never lose that devotee: 'sa ca me na praṇaśyati' — he is never lost to Me. Yogananda found this verse profoundly consoling: even when the meditator is beset by doubts, distractions, and spiritual dryness, they are still in God's sight. The relationship, once established, is eternal.",
        "goyandka": "The Gita Press commentary reads this verse as the culmination of the entire Chapter 6 teaching and the transition to Chapter 7, which opens with bhakti-jñāna (devotion united with knowledge). The reciprocal structure — 'tasyāhaṃ na praṇaśyāmi / sa ca me na praṇaśyati' — mirrors the reciprocal vision of verse 29 (Self in all, all in Self) but at the personal level of the Divine-devotee relationship. Goyandka notes that the word 'praṇaśyati' (not merely 'naśyati' but with the prefix 'pra' intensifying the meaning) emphasizes complete, absolute invisibility — which is what is being negated. There is no possibility, however slight, of the realized devotee losing sight of Krishna or of Krishna losing sight of the devotee. This mutual seeing — the Divine beholding the devotee, the devotee beholding the Divine — is the essence of the bhakta's relationship with God."
